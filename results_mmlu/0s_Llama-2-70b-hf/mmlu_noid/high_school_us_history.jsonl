Tonight, the daughter of an immigrant from Italy has been chosen to run for (vice) president in the new land my father came to love.\u2026 Americans want to live by the same set of rules. But under this administration, the rules are rigged against too many of our people. It isn't right that every year the share of taxes paid by individual citizens is going up, while the share paid by large corporations is getting smaller and smaller.\u2026 It isn't right that young couples question whether to bring children into a world of 50,000 nuclear warheads.

The result was a distinctively Latin American form of rights discourse. Paolo Carozza traces the roots of that discourse to a distinctive application, and extension, of Thomistic moral philosophy to the injustices of Spanish conquests in the New World. The key figure in that development seems to have been Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas, a 16th-century Spanish bishop who condemned slavery and championed the cause of Indians on the basis of a natural right to liberty grounded in their membership in a single common humanity. 'All the peoples of the world are humans,' Las Casas wrote, and 'all the races of humankind are one.' According to Brian Tierney, Las Casas and other Spanish Dominican philosophers laid the groundwork for a doctrine of natural rights that was independent of religious revelation 'by drawing on a juridical tradition that derived natural rights and natural law from human rationality and free will, and by appealing to Aristotelian philosophy.'\"\nMary Ann Glendon, \"The Forgotten Crucible: The Latin American Influence on the Universal Human Rights Idea,\u201d 2003\nWhich one of the following statements about the Spanish conquest of the Americas is most accurate?\nOptions:\nAfrican slavery was a direct result of Spanish settlements in Florida.\nEarly native civilizations in Mexico introduced Spanish explorers to cattle ranching and wheat cultivation.\nChristopher Columbus was not the first European to have explored North America.\nDue to racial prejudice, Spanish explorers shunned intermarriage with native people.\nAnswer:", "options": ["African slavery was a direct result of Spanish settlements in Florida.", "Early native civilizations in Mexico introduced Spanish explorers to cattle ranching and wheat cultivation.", "Christopher Columbus was not the first European to have explored North America.", "Due to racial prejudice, Spanish explorers shunned intermarriage with native people."], "lengths": [14, 22, 15, 22], "losses": [0.440525084733963, 0.40986013412475586, 0.3438068926334381, 0.1435002237558365], "probs": [0.22328712187964353, 0.23024027463503244, 0.24596190776295151, 0.3005106956923214], "sampled": "D", "ideal": "C", "correct": false}}

The 55% popular vote for the president was the third largest in the nineteenth century, surpassed only by Jackson's first victory in 1828 and Grant's reelection in 1872. McClellan won only New Jersey, Delaware, and Kentucky. Republicans drew support from native-born farmers, skilled and professional workers, those of New England descent, younger voters, and military personnel. Democrats were strongest in the cities and among Irish- and German-Americans (the most populous immigrant groups). It has been estimated that Lincoln received 78% of the vote of Union soldiers and sailors. The figure was not necessary for his reelection, but was perhaps the margin of victory in a few close states and, more importantly, of great symbolic value. Republicans also gained seats in Congress to retain unassailable control, 149 to 42 in the House and 42 to 10 in the Senate; took back several state legislatures; and lost only the governorship of New Jersey (McClellan's home state).\"\nElection of 1864, Harpweek.com\nWhich of the following conclusions is best supported by the excerpt above?\nOptions:\nLincoln received more votes in the heavily populated states of the North, while McClellan won more sparsely populated states.\nLincoln won the Election of 1864 due to Union successes during the Civil War.\nThe Emancipation Proclamation mobilized black voters in the South to vote for Lincoln in the Election of 1864.\nRepublicans managed to gain control of Congress through the efforts of Lincoln to campaign on their behalf.\nAnswer:", "options": ["Lincoln received more votes in the heavily populated states of the North, while McClellan won more sparsely populated states.", "Lincoln won the Election of 1864 due to Union successes during the Civil War.", "The Emancipation Proclamation mobilized black voters in the South to vote for Lincoln in the Election of 1864.", "Republicans managed to gain control of Congress through the efforts of Lincoln to campaign on their behalf."], "lengths": [26, 21, 31, 20], "losses": [0.13167980313301086, 0.1795995533466339, 0.22282199561595917, 0.1780669391155243], "probs": [0.2617273154399825, 0.24948116735401304, 0.23892769828464022, 0.24986381889519138], "sampled": "A", "ideal": "A", "correct": true}}

The 55% popular vote for the president was the third largest in the nineteenth century, surpassed only by Jackson's first victory in 1828 and Grant's reelection in 1872. McClellan won only New Jersey, Delaware, and Kentucky. Republicans drew support from native-born farmers, skilled and professional workers, those of New England descent, younger voters, and military personnel. Democrats were strongest in the cities and among Irish- and German-Americans (the most populous immigrant groups). It has been estimated that Lincoln received 78% of the vote of Union soldiers and sailors. The figure was not necessary for his reelection, but was perhaps the margin of victory in a few close states and, more importantly, of great symbolic value. Republicans also gained seats in Congress to retain unassailable control, 149 to 42 in the House and 42 to 10 in the Senate; took back several state legislatures; and lost only the governorship of New Jersey (McClellan's home state).\"\nElection of 1864, Harpweek.com\nWhich of the following provides the best explanation for why Radical Republicans opposed Lincoln in 1861?\nOptions:\nLincoln's decision to issue the Emancipation Proclamation was done without congressional oversight.\nThe Radical Republicans wanted immediate emancipation of slaves, but Lincoln refused to cooperate.\nLincoln's Ten Percent Plan provided no assurance of black suffrage.\nLincoln's appointment of Andrew Johnson as vice president clashed with the Reconstruction goals of the Senate.\nAnswer:", "options": ["Lincoln's decision to issue the Emancipation Proclamation was done without congressional oversight.", "The Radical Republicans wanted immediate emancipation of slaves, but Lincoln refused to cooperate.", "Lincoln's Ten Percent Plan provided no assurance of black suffrage.", "Lincoln's appointment of Andrew Johnson as vice president clashed with the Reconstruction goals of the Senate."], "lengths": [24, 22, 16, 22], "losses": [0.18730391561985016, 0.12106401473283768, 0.33937010169029236, 0.3354380428791046], "probs": [0.26387104837465375, 0.28194173371984266, 0.22664713680090412, 0.22754008107640536], "sampled": "B", "ideal": "B", "correct": true}}

The result was a distinctively Latin American form of rights discourse. Paolo Carozza traces the roots of that discourse to a distinctive application, and extension, of Thomistic moral philosophy to the injustices of Spanish conquests in the New World. The key figure in that development seems to have been Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas, a 16th-century Spanish bishop who condemned slavery and championed the cause of Indians on the basis of a natural right to liberty grounded in their membership in a single common humanity. 'All the peoples of the world are humans,' Las Casas wrote, and 'all the races of humankind are one.' According to Brian Tierney, Las Casas and other Spanish Dominican philosophers laid the groundwork for a doctrine of natural rights that was independent of religious revelation 'by drawing on a juridical tradition that derived natural rights and natural law from human rationality and free will, and by appealing to Aristotelian philosophy.'\"\nMary Ann Glendon, \"The Forgotten Crucible: The Latin American Influence on the Universal Human Rights Idea,\u201d 2003\nMaize cultivation among the native peoples of Mexico is most analogous to which of the following?\nOptions:\nBuffalo hunting among the Lakota Sioux\nWolf domestication by the Algonquians\nMixed agriculture among the Iroquois\nSeal hunting among the Inuit\nAnswer:", "options": ["Buffalo hunting among the Lakota Sioux", "Wolf domestication by the Algonquians", "Mixed agriculture among the Iroquois", "Seal hunting among the Inuit"], "lengths": [9, 9, 10, 7], "losses": [0.2872445583343506, 0.38311758637428284, 0.4089871048927307, 0.37075164914131165], "probs": [0.2692630649073956, 0.24464686664492358, 0.23839913137751018, 0.24769093704324432], "sampled": "A", "ideal": "C", "correct": false}}

The result was a distinctively Latin American form of rights discourse. Paolo Carozza traces the roots of that discourse to a distinctive application, and extension, of Thomistic moral philosophy to the injustices of Spanish conquests in the New World. The key figure in that development seems to have been Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas, a 16th-century Spanish bishop who condemned slavery and championed the cause of Indians on the basis of a natural right to liberty grounded in their membership in a single common humanity. 'All the peoples of the world are humans,' Las Casas wrote, and 'all the races of humankind are one.' According to Brian Tierney, Las Casas and other Spanish Dominican philosophers laid the groundwork for a doctrine of natural rights that was independent of religious revelation 'by drawing on a juridical tradition that derived natural rights and natural law from human rationality and free will, and by appealing to Aristotelian philosophy.'\"\nMary Ann Glendon, \"The Forgotten Crucible: The Latin American Influence on the Universal Human Rights Idea,\u201d 2003\nWhich of the following presidents was most involved in Latin American politics in the twentieth century?\nOptions:\nJames K.

Jefferson was very tall, six feet two-and-a-half inches in height; sandy-complexioned; shy in manner, seeming cold; awkward in attitude, and with little in his bearing that suggested command.\u2026 His skin was thin, peeling from his face on exposure to the sun, giving it a tettered appearance. This sandy face, with hazel eyes and sunny aspect; this loose, shackling person; this rambling and often brilliant conversation, belonged to the controlling influences of American history, more necessary to the story than three-fourths of the official papers, which only hid the truth. Jefferson's personality during these eight years appeared to be the government, and impressed itself, like that of Bonaparte, although by a different process, on the mind of the nation. In the village simplicity of Washington, he was more than a king, for he was alone in social as well as in political pre-eminence.

Neither do they now promise us any substantial reform. They have agreed together to ignore, in the coming campaign, every issue but one. They propose to drown the outcries of a plundered people with the uproar of a sham battle over the tariff, so that capitalists, corporations, national banks, rings, trusts, watered stock, the demonetization of silver and the oppressions of the usurers may all be lost sight of. They propose to sacrifice our homes, lives, and children on the altar of mammon; to destroy the multitude in order to secure corruption funds from the millionaires.\n\"Assembled on the anniversary of the birthday of the nation, and filled with the spirit of the grand general and chief who established our independence, we seek to restore the government of the Republic to the hands of 'the plain people,' with which class it originated.

It demands an end to poverty and racial injustice, to which we are totally committed in our time. But that is just the beginning. The Great Society is a place where every child can find knowledge to enrich his mind and to enlarge his talents. It is a place where leisure is a welcome chance to build and reflect, not a feared cause of boredom and restlessness. It is a place where the city of man serves not only the needs of the body and the demands of commerce but the desire for beauty and the hunger for community. It is a place where man can renew contact with nature. It is a place which honors creation for its own sake and for what it adds to the understanding of the race. It is a place where men are more concerned with the quality of their goals than the quantity of their goods. But most of all, the Great Society is not a safe harbor, a resting place, a final objective, a finished work.

Jefferson's personality during these eight years appeared to be the government, and impressed itself, like that of Bonaparte, although by a different process, on the mind of the nation.

Now, I can't say that I will agree with all the things that the present group who call themselves Libertarians in the sense of a party say, because I think that like in any political movement there are shades, and there are libertarians who are almost over at the point of wanting no government at all or anarchy. I believe there are legitimate government functions. There is a legitimate need in an orderly society for some government to maintain freedom or we will have tyranny by individuals.

It demands an end to poverty and racial injustice, to which we are totally committed in our time. But that is just the beginning. The Great Society is a place where every child can find knowledge to enrich his mind and to enlarge his talents. It is a place where leisure is a welcome chance to build and reflect, not a feared cause of boredom and restlessness. It is a place where the city of man serves not only the needs of the body and the demands of commerce but the desire for beauty and the hunger for community. It is a place where man can renew contact with nature. It is a place which honors creation for its own sake and for what it adds to the understanding of the race. It is a place where men are more concerned with the quality of their goals than the quantity of their goods. But most of all, the Great Society is not a safe harbor, a resting place, a final objective, a finished work. It is a challenge constantly renewed, beckoning us toward a destiny where the meaning of our lives matches the marvelous products of our labor.\"\nLyndon Johnson, Remarks at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 1964\nWhich one of the following was an unintended consequence of the liberal successes of the 1960s?\nOptions:\nLiberal Democrats abandoned anti-war protests in a show of support for President Johnson.\nConservative Republicans mobilized to defend traditional mores and curb government authority.\nEconomic recession catalyzed by increased government spending causing \"stagflation.\"\nA majority of Northern black voters abandoned the Democrat party, siding with Republicans.\nAnswer:", "options": ["Liberal Democrats abandoned anti-war protests in a show of support for President Johnson.", "Conservative Republicans mobilized to defend traditional mores and curb government authority.", "Economic recession catalyzed by increased government spending causing \"stagflation.\"", "A majority of Northern black voters abandoned the Democrat party, siding with Republicans."], "lengths": [18, 17, 19, 19], "losses": [0.360647052526474, 0.14019453525543213, 0.319096177816391, 0.3413758873939514], "probs": [0.23209799307551915, 0.289342811386672, 0.24194502747153881, 0.2366141680373357], "sampled": "B", "ideal": "B", "correct": true}}

Sir, we have done everything that could be done, to avert the storm which is now coming on. We have petitioned; we have remonstrated; we have supplicated; we have prostrated ourselves before the throne, and have implored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and Parliament. Our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances have produced additional violence and insult; our supplications have been disregarded; and we have been spurned, with contempt, from the foot of the throne. In vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation. There is no longer any room for hope.\u2026 It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry, Peace, Peace, but there is no peace. The war is actually begun! The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our brethren are already in the field! Why stand we here idle? What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God!

You should directly answer the question by choosing the correct option.\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nHere is the case of a woman employed in the manufacturing department of a Broadway house. It stands for a hundred like her own. She averages three dollars a week. Pay is $1.50 for her room; for breakfast she has a cup of coffee; lunch she cannot afford. One meal a day is her allowance. This woman is young, she is pretty. She has \"the world before her.\" Is it anything less than a miracle if she is guilty of nothing less than the \"early and improvident marriage,\" against which moralists exclaim as one of the prolific causes of the distresses of the poor? Almost any door might seem to offer a welcome escape from such slavery as this. \"I feel so much healthier since I got three square meals a day,\" said a lodger in one of the Girls' Homes. Two young sewing-girls came in seeking domestic service, so that they might get enough to eat. They had been only half-fed for some time, and starvation had driven them to the one door at which the pride of the American-born girl will not permit her to knock, though poverty be the price of her independence.\n\u2014Jacob Riis, How the Other Half Lives, 1890\nRiis's work as an investigator of the lives of the poor can most directly be associated with which of the following?\nOptions:\nYellow Journalism\nAbolitionism\nThe muckrakers\nSocialism\nAnswer:", "options": ["Yellow Journalism", "Abolitionism", "The muckrakers", "Socialism"], "lengths": [4, 4, 5, 2], "losses": [1.1923269033432007, 1.456224799156189, 0.3904324173927307, 1.9050172567367554], "probs": [0.22280962680048147, 0.17112936989673844, 0.4968122565606957, 0.10924874669240313], "sampled": "C", "ideal": "C", "correct": true}}
