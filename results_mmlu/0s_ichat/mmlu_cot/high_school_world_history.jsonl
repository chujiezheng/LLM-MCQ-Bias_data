On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.

Gunpowder weapons were primarily used for warfare and did not have a direct impact on the division of lands between Portugal and Spain.\n\nB. The compass: The compass was a crucial navigational tool during the Age of Exploration, which occurred around the same time as the signing of the Treaty of Tordesillas. It allowed sailors to determine their direction and navigate more accurately. This technology directly influenced the exploration and discovery of new lands, which is the subject of the treaty.\n\nC.

Steel was used for weapons, tools, and armor, but it did not have a direct impact on the division of lands between Portugal and Spain.\n\nD. Germ Theory: Germ Theory, which explains the causes of infectious diseases, was not developed until the late 19th century by Louis Pasteur.

Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system.

The invention of the machine gun: The invention of the machine gun greatly increased Europe's military power and made it easier for them to conquer and control territories. This would have significantly contributed to Europe's ability to penetrate Africa.\n\nB. The invention of vaccines for tropical diseases: The invention of vaccines for tropical diseases would have helped Europeans to survive and resist diseases that were prevalent in Africa. This would have made it easier for them to establish and maintain a presence in Africa.\n\nC. The development of the joint-stock company: The development of the joint-stock company allowed for the pooling of resources and the sharing of risks in business ventures. This would have facilitated European investment and colonization in Africa.\n\nD. The invention of steam-powered ships: The invention of steam-powered ships revolutionized transportation and made it faster and more efficient.

The passage mentions that workers are experiencing low wages and poor working conditions.\n2. It also mentions that children are being sent to work out of necessity.\n3. The question asks which type of organization was partially responsible for improving the hours, wages, and working conditions of workers in this era.\n\nBased on this information, we can eliminate options A, B, and D:\n\nA. Guilds: Guilds were associations of craftsmen and merchants in medieval Europe. They were not active during the time period mentioned in the passage (1831-32) and did not have a direct role in improving the conditions of industrial workers.\n\nB. Joint-stock companies: Joint-stock companies were business entities that allowed investors to pool their capital for large-scale ventures. While they played a role in the development of industry and trade, they were not primarily concerned with improving the conditions of workers.\n\nD. Zaibatsu groups: Zaibatsu groups were large industrial and financial conglomerates in Japan during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They were not active in the UK during the time period mentioned in the passage.\n\nThis leaves us with option C:\n\nC. Labor unions: Labor unions are organizations formed by workers to protect their rights and improve their working conditions. They advocate for better wages, shorter hours, and safer working conditions. In this era, labor unions were emerging as a response to the harsh conditions faced by workers in the early stages of industrialization. The passage mentions the necessity of sending children to work, indicating the need for better conditions. Labor unions played a significant role in advocating for workers' rights and pushing for reforms during this time period.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.
