High glycaemic index carbohydrates: These are carbohydrates that are quickly digested and cause a rapid increase in blood sugar levels.

A high n-6:n-3 fat ratio: The n-6 and n-3 fatty acids are essential fatty acids that our bodies need for proper functioning.

Both options suggest low levels of hemoglobin and low levels of ferritin, which are consistent with iron deficiency. However, we need to consider the levels of serum transferrin receptors and hepcidin.\n\nIn the presence of iron deficiency, serum transferrin receptors are typically elevated as the body tries to increase iron uptake. Therefore, option B, which suggests high levels of serum transferrin receptors, is more likely to be found in a person with both iron deficiency and a severe infection.\n\nOption D suggests low levels of serum transferrin receptors, which would not be expected in the presence of iron deficiency.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.
