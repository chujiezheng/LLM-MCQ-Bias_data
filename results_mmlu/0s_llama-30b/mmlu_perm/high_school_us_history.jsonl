There is an average of $15,000 in wealth to every family in America. That is right here today.\nWe do not propose to divide it up equally. We do not propose a division of wealth, but we do propose to limit poverty that we will allow to be inflicted on any man's family. We will not say we are going to try to guarantee any equality \u2026 but we do say that one third of the average is low enough for any one family to hold, that there should be a guarantee of a family wealth of around $5,000; enough for a home, an automobile, a radio, and the ordinary conveniences, and the opportunity to educate their children.\u2026\nWe will have to limit fortunes. Our present plan is that we will allow no man to own more than $50,000,000. We think that with that limit we will be able to carry out the balance of the program.\n\u2014Senator Huey P.

You should directly answer the question by choosing the correct option.\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nThe 1980s have been born in turmoil, strife, and change. This is a time of challenge to our interests and our values and it's a time that tests our wisdom and skills.\nAt this time in Iran, 50 Americans are still held captive, innocent victims of terrorism and anarchy. Also at this moment, massive Soviet troops are attempting to subjugate the fiercely independent and deeply religious people of Afghanistan. These two acts\u2014one of international terrorism and one of military aggression\u2014present a serious challenge to the United States of America and indeed to all the nations of the world. Together we will meet these threats to peace.\u2026\nThree basic developments have helped to shape our challenges: the steady growth and increased projection of Soviet military power beyond its own borders; the overwhelming dependence of the Western democracies on oil supplies from the Middle East; and the press of social and religious and economic and political change in the many nations of the developing world, exemplified by the revolution in Iran.\nEach of these factors is important in its own right. Each interacts with the others. All must be faced together, squarely and courageously. We will face these challenges, and we will meet them with the best that is in us. And we will not fail.\n\u2014Jimmy Carter, State of the Union Address, January 23, 1980\nThe situation Carter described led most directly to which of the following?\nOptions:\nA.

But we do not have the right to resort to violence\u2014or the threat of violence\u2014when we don't get our way. Our founders constructed a system of government so that reason could prevail over fear. Oklahoma City proved once again that without the law there is no freedom. Criticism is part of the lifeblood of democracy. No one is right all the time.

But about the 16th of March, a certain Indian came boldly amongst them and spoke to them in broken English, which they could well understand but marveled at it. At length they understood by discourse with him, that he was not of these parts, but belonged to the eastern parts where some English ships came to fish, with whom he was acquainted and could name sundry of them by their names, amongst whom he had got his language. He became profitable to them in acquainting them with many things concerning the state of the country in the east parts where he lived, which was afterwards profitable unto them; as also of the people here, of their names, number and strength, of their situation and distance from the place, and who was chief amongst them. His name was Samoset.

Men who are honorable in their dealings with their white neighbors will cheat a Negro without feeling a single twinge of their honor. To kill a Negro they do not deem murder; to debauch a Negro woman they do not think fornication; to take the property away from a Negro they do not consider robbery. The people boast that when they get freedmen affairs in their own hands, to use their own classic expression, 'the niggers will catch hell.'\n\"The reason of all this is simple and manifest. The whites esteem the blacks their property by natural right, and however much they may admit that the individual relations of masters and slaves have been destroyed by the war and the President's emancipation proclamation, they still have an ingrained feeling that the blacks at large belong to the whites at large, and whenever opportunity serves they treat the colored people just as their profit, caprice or passion may dictate.\"\n\u2014Congressional testimony of Col.

After a recital of a case of peculiar hardship one of them exclaimed: \"Wouldn't it be fine if we had a boarding club of our own, and then we could stand behind each other in a time like this?\" After that events moved quickly. We \u2026 discussed all the difficulties and fascinations of such an undertaking, and on the first of May, 1891, two comfortable apartments near Hull House were rented and furnished.

We charge that the controlling influences dominating both these parties have permitted the existing dreadful conditions to develop without serious effort to prevent or restrain them. Neither do they now promise us any substantial reform. They have agreed together to ignore, in the coming campaign, every issue but one. They propose to drown the outcries of a plundered people with the uproar of a sham battle over the tariff, so that capitalists, corporations, national banks, rings, trusts, watered stock, the demonetization of silver and the oppressions of the usurers may all be lost sight of. They propose to sacrifice our homes, lives, and children on the altar of mammon; to destroy the multitude in order to secure corruption funds from the millionaires.\n\"Assembled on the anniversary of the birthday of the nation, and filled with the spirit of the grand general and chief who established our independence, we seek to restore the government of the Republic to the hands of 'the plain people,' with which class it originated. We assert our purposes to be identical with the purposes of the National Constitution; to form a more perfect union and establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty for ourselves and our posterity.\"\nPopulist Party Platform, 1892\nWhich one of the following political movements most closely shared many of the goals outlined by the Populist Party?\nOptions:\nA.

Realizing that the power to tax is the power to destroy and that the power to take a certain amount of property or of income is only another way of saying that for a certain proportion of his time a citizen must work for the government, the authority to impose a tax on the people has been most carefully guarded.\u2026 A government which lays taxes on the people not required by urgent necessity and sound public policy is not a protector of liberty, but an instrument of tyranny. It condemns the citizen to tyranny. One of the first signs of the breaking down of free government is a disregard by the taxing power of the right of the people to their own property.\u2026 Unless the people can enjoy that reasonable security in the possession of their property, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, against unreasonable taxation, freedom is at an end.\u2026 With us economy is imperative.

Men who are honorable in their dealings with their white neighbors will cheat a Negro without feeling a single twinge of their honor. To kill a Negro they do not deem murder; to debauch a Negro woman they do not think fornication; to take the property away from a Negro they do not consider robbery. The people boast that when they get freedmen affairs in their own hands, to use their own classic expression, 'the niggers will catch hell.'\n\"The reason of all this is simple and manifest. The whites esteem the blacks their property by natural right, and however much they may admit that the individual relations of masters and slaves have been destroyed by the war and the President's emancipation proclamation, they still have an ingrained feeling that the blacks at large belong to the whites at large, and whenever opportunity serves they treat the colored people just as their profit, caprice or passion may dictate.\"\n\u2014Congressional testimony of Col.

I think conservatism is really a misnomer just as liberalism is a misnomer for the liberals\u2014if we were back in the days of the Revolution, so-called conservatives today would be the Liberals and the liberals would be the Tories. The basis of conservatism is a desire for less government interference or less centralized authority or more individual freedom and this is a pretty general description also of what libertarianism is. Now, I can't say that I will agree with all the things that the present group who call themselves Libertarians in the sense of a party say, because I think that like in any political movement there are shades, and there are libertarians who are almost over at the point of wanting no government at all or anarchy. I believe there are legitimate government functions. There is a legitimate need in an orderly society for some government to maintain freedom or we will have tyranny by individuals. The strongest man on the block will run the neighborhood. We have government to ensure that we don't each one of us have to carry a club to defend ourselves.

Jefferson was very tall, six feet two-and-a-half inches in height; sandy-complexioned; shy in manner, seeming cold; awkward in attitude, and with little in his bearing that suggested command.\u2026 His skin was thin, peeling from his face on exposure to the sun, giving it a tettered appearance. This sandy face, with hazel eyes and sunny aspect; this loose, shackling person; this rambling and often brilliant conversation, belonged to the controlling influences of American history, more necessary to the story than three-fourths of the official papers, which only hid the truth. Jefferson's personality during these eight years appeared to be the government, and impressed itself, like that of Bonaparte, although by a different process, on the mind of the nation. In the village simplicity of Washington, he was more than a king, for he was alone in social as well as in political pre-eminence. Except the British Legation, no house in Washington was open to general society; the whole mass of politicians, even the Federalists, were dependent on Jefferson and \"The Palace\" for amusement; and if they refused to go there, they \"lived like bears, brutalized and stupefied.\"\n\u2014Henry Adams, History of the United States During the Administration of Thomas Jefferson, 1889\nAccording to Henry Adams, the city of Washington in 1801 was\nOptions:\nA. the hub of American economic power\nB. rapidly turning into the \"Paris\" of North America\nC. still an underdeveloped cultural backwater\nD. still under the control of the British\nAnswer:", "options": ["the hub of American economic power", "rapidly turning into the \"Paris\" of North America", "still an underdeveloped cultural backwater", "still under the control of the British"], "probs": [[0.16368991136550903, 0.19927465915679932, 0.4688877761363983, 0.16814762353897095], [0.18083640933036804, 0.19304265081882477, 0.23774006962776184, 0.38838091492652893], [0.1402338445186615, 0.7279150485992432, 0.047216519713401794, 0.08463457226753235], [0.14716388285160065, 0.6334276795387268, 0.07855620980262756, 0.1408521682024002], [0.20193345844745636, 0.22602605819702148, 0.2183302789926529, 0.3537101745605469], [0.16533194482326508, 0.1879206746816635, 0.3570689857006073, 0.2896784543991089], [0.14231908321380615, 0.13909529149532318, 0.5654827952384949, 0.1531028300523758], [0.18736281991004944, 0.13629481196403503, 0.25804343819618225, 0.4182989299297333], [0.1590576469898224, 0.6896475553512573, 0.05974791571497917, 0.09154684096574783], [0.190346360206604, 0.5759727358818054, 0.09399031847715378, 0.13969066739082336], [0.24649161100387573, 0.23414038121700287, 0.19348235428333282, 0.3258856534957886], [0.20114699006080627, 0.19849175214767456, 0.3835330605506897, 0.2168281227350235], [0.7627557516098022, 0.08941839635372162, 0.0739777609705925, 0.07384813576936722], [0.646006166934967, 0.11118051409721375, 0.10186667740345001, 0.140946626663208], [0.7816006541252136, 0.08086387068033218, 0.06534302234649658, 0.07219243049621582], [0.6799191832542419, 0.1057010218501091, 0.09606916457414627, 0.11831064522266388], [0.653698205947876, 0.12950247526168823, 0.09758742898702621, 0.11921189725399017], [0.6458389163017273, 0.13728168606758118, 0.10181642323732376, 0.11506296694278717], [0.24837663769721985, 0.21642573177814484, 0.2043263167142868, 0.3308713436126709], [0.20549844205379486, 0.18615995347499847, 0.3429904282093048, 0.2653510868549347], [0.26250144839286804, 0.232376828789711, 0.18912354111671448, 0.3159981667995453], [0.23467105627059937, 0.19652970135211945, 0.35406285524368286, 0.21473641693592072], [0.30193957686424255, 0.34362754225730896, 0.12885504961013794, 0.22557780146598816], [0.32904064655303955, 0.3328123092651367, 0.1328968107700348, 0.20525027811527252]], "ideal": "C"}}

It is better for them to be ruled thus.\"\nJuan de Sepulveda, Politics, 1522\n\"When Latin American nations gained independence in the 19th century, those two strains converged, and merged with an older, more universalist, natural law tradition. The result was a distinctively Latin American form of rights discourse. Paolo Carozza traces the roots of that discourse to a distinctive application, and extension, of Thomistic moral philosophy to the injustices of Spanish conquests in the New World. The key figure in that development seems to have been Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas, a 16th-century Spanish bishop who condemned slavery and championed the cause of Indians on the basis of a natural right to liberty grounded in their membership in a single common humanity. 'All the peoples of the world are humans,' Las Casas wrote, and 'all the races of humankind are one.' According to Brian Tierney, Las Casas and other Spanish Dominican philosophers laid the groundwork for a doctrine of natural rights that was independent of religious revelation 'by drawing on a juridical tradition that derived natural rights and natural law from human rationality and free will, and by appealing to Aristotelian philosophy.'\"\nMary Ann Glendon, \"The Forgotten Crucible: The Latin American Influence on the Universal Human Rights Idea,\u201d 2003\nWhich one of the following statements about the Spanish conquest of the Americas is most accurate?\nOptions:\nA.

{"type": "result", "data": {"idx": 62, "prompt": "The following are multiple choice questions about high school us history. You should directly answer the question by choosing the correct option.\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nThe man who mounted the steps of the Capitol, March 4, 1801, to claim the place of an equal between Pitt and Bonaparte, possessed a character which showed itself in acts; but person and manner can be known only by contemporaries, and the liveliest description was worth less than a moment of personal contact. Jefferson was very tall, six feet two-and-a-half inches in height; sandy-complexioned; shy in manner, seeming cold; awkward in attitude, and with little in his bearing that suggested command.\u2026 His skin was thin, peeling from his face on exposure to the sun, giving it a tettered appearance. This sandy face, with hazel eyes and sunny aspect; this loose, shackling person; this rambling and often brilliant conversation, belonged to the controlling influences of American history, more necessary to the story than three-fourths of the official papers, which only hid the truth. Jefferson's personality during these eight years appeared to be the government, and impressed itself, like that of Bonaparte, although by a different process, on the mind of the nation.

Now, largely because of the troubled state of the world as a whole, civil liberties have disappeared in many other countries.\nIt is impossible, of course, to be at war and keep freedom of the press and freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. They disappear automatically. And so in many countries where ordinarily they were safe, today they have gone. In other countries, even before war came, not only freedom of the press and freedom of assembly, and freedom of speech disappeared, but freedom of religion disappeared.\nAnd so we know here in this country, we have a grave responsibility. We are at peace. We have no reason for the fears which govern so many other peoples throughout the world; therefore, we have to guard the freedoms of democracy.\n\u2014Eleanor Roosevelt, Address to the American Civil Liberties Union, Chicago, Illinois, March 14, 1940\nRoosevelt's concerns can most directly be compared to those of the people who debated which of the following?\nOptions:\nA.

Our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances have produced additional violence and insult; our supplications have been disregarded; and we have been spurned, with contempt, from the foot of the throne.

But about the 16th of March, a certain Indian came boldly amongst them and spoke to them in broken English, which they could well understand but marveled at it. At length they understood by discourse with him, that he was not of these parts, but belonged to the eastern parts where some English ships came to fish, with whom he was acquainted and could name sundry of them by their names, amongst whom he had got his language. He became profitable to them in acquainting them with many things concerning the state of the country in the east parts where he lived, which was afterwards profitable unto them; as also of the people here, of their names, number and strength, of their situation and distance from the place, and who was chief amongst them. His name was Samoset.

Dangers and difficulties, instead of deterring, seemed to have a charm in his eyes.\u2026 He conceived, at the first moment of his landing in Mexico, the design of its conquest. When he saw the strength of its civilization, he was not turned from his purpose.\u2026 This spirit of knight-errantry might lead us to undervalue his talents as a general, and to regard him merely in the light of a lucky adventurer. But this would be doing him injustice; for Cortes was certainly a great general, if that man be one, who performs great achievements with the resources which his own genius has created. There is probably no instance in history, where so vast an enterprise has been achieved by means apparently so inadequate.\u2026 He brought together the most miscellaneous collection of mercenaries who ever fought under one standard: adventurers from Cuba and the Isles, craving for gold; hidalgos, who came from the old country to win laurels; \u2026 wild tribes of the natives from all parts of the country, who had been sworn enemies from their cradles, and who had met only to cut one another's throats, and to procure victims for sacrifice; men, in short, differing in race, in language, and in interests, with scarcely anything in common among them.

You should directly answer the question by choosing the correct option.\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\n\"We have witnessed for more than a quarter of a century the struggles of the two great political parties for power and plunder, while grievous wrongs have been inflicted upon the suffering people. We charge that the controlling influences dominating both these parties have permitted the existing dreadful conditions to develop without serious effort to prevent or restrain them. Neither do they now promise us any substantial reform. They have agreed together to ignore, in the coming campaign, every issue but one. They propose to drown the outcries of a plundered people with the uproar of a sham battle over the tariff, so that capitalists, corporations, national banks, rings, trusts, watered stock, the demonetization of silver and the oppressions of the usurers may all be lost sight of. They propose to sacrifice our homes, lives, and children on the altar of mammon; to destroy the multitude in order to secure corruption funds from the millionaires.\n\"Assembled on the anniversary of the birthday of the nation, and filled with the spirit of the grand general and chief who established our independence, we seek to restore the government of the Republic to the hands of 'the plain people,' with which class it originated. We assert our purposes to be identical with the purposes of the National Constitution; to form a more perfect union and establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty for ourselves and our posterity.\"\nPopulist Party Platform, 1892\nWhich of the following is LEAST associated with the Populist movement?\nOptions:\nA.

The fact that you have been treated, by common consent and common usage, as aliens and brutes, is not proof that such treatment is legal, but only shows the strength, the bitterness, and the blindness of prejudice.\"\n\u2014William Lloyd Garrison, \"To the Free People of Color of the United States,\" The Liberator, January 15, 1831\nThe approach of William Lloyd Garrison and The Liberator can best be seen as\nOptions:\nA. an outgrowth of the Second Great Awakening.\nB. an expression of Transcendentalist individualism.\nC. a reflection of literary romanticism.\nD. a rejection of the idea of \"Republican motherhood.\"\nAnswer:", "options": ["an outgrowth of the Second Great Awakening.", "an expression of Transcendentalist individualism.", "a reflection of literary romanticism.", "a rejection of the idea of \"Republican motherhood.\""], "probs": [[0.4650435745716095, 0.2253062129020691, 0.16299112141132355, 0.14665912091732025], [0.5449421405792236, 0.2023426741361618, 0.1364241987466812, 0.11629097908735275], [0.43197867274284363, 0.23351174592971802, 0.18130330741405487, 0.1532062292098999], [0.49517470598220825, 0.2150249481201172, 0.1519603580236435, 0.13784006237983704], [0.5420241355895996, 0.1707495152950287, 0.1611691266298294, 0.1260572224855423], [0.5059565901756287, 0.1764734387397766, 0.1652635782957077, 0.1523064225912094], [0.3119049072265625, 0.3204704821109772, 0.19353576004505157, 0.17408883571624756], [0.360493540763855, 0.3345660865306854, 0.1688019335269928, 0.13613839447498322], [0.2951030731201172, 0.26537641882896423, 0.25858157873153687, 0.1809389442205429], [0.3079627454280853, 0.2642180621623993, 0.20349954068660736, 0.22431962192058563], [0.38032302260398865, 0.2172197848558426, 0.24952591955661774, 0.152931347489357], [0.3298003673553467, 0.20529182255268097, 0.23384851217269897, 0.23105931282043457], [0.258564829826355, 0.37803953886032104, 0.19982196390628815, 0.16357366740703583], [0.29033613204956055, 0.3924730718135834, 0.17193295061588287, 0.14525781571865082], [0.25876227021217346, 0.3085986077785492, 0.2569877505302429, 0.17565137147903442], [0.2684791088104248, 0.3079005479812622, 0.1948949545621872, 0.228725403547287], [0.2973293662071228, 0.2233547568321228, 0.2955043911933899, 0.1838115006685257], [0.25084856152534485, 0.18988169729709625, 0.2890360355377197, 0.27023375034332275], [0.2772713899612427, 0.3306185305118561, 0.22986756265163422, 0.1622425615787506], [0.26595011353492737, 0.3072872757911682, 0.2221713662147522, 0.20459124445915222], [0.2555006146430969, 0.2975378930568695, 0.28529977798461914, 0.1616617739200592], [0.22771619260311127, 0.265112966299057, 0.25012630224227905, 0.2570445239543915], [0.25181815028190613, 0.2732902467250824, 0.28116685152053833, 0.19372475147247314], [0.21988487243652344, 0.24421869218349457, 0.27377849817276, 0.2621179223060608]], "ideal": "A"}}

But the payment of duties laid by an act of Parliament as regulations of commerce was never disputed. . . . An external tax is a duty laid on commodities imported; that duty is added to the first cost and other charges on the commodity, and, when it is offered for sale, makes a part of the price. If the people do not like it at that price, they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it. But an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it.\"\n\u2014Benjamin Franklin, Examination before Parliament, 1766\nPresident Jackson's policy was later altered by the\nOptions:\nA.

Now, largely because of the troubled state of the world as a whole, civil liberties have disappeared in many other countries.\nIt is impossible, of course, to be at war and keep freedom of the press and freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. They disappear automatically. And so in many countries where ordinarily they were safe, today they have gone. In other countries, even before war came, not only freedom of the press and freedom of assembly, and freedom of speech disappeared, but freedom of religion disappeared.\nAnd so we know here in this country, we have a grave responsibility. We are at peace.

Two young sewing-girls came in seeking domestic service, so that they might get enough to eat.

You should directly answer the question by choosing the correct option.\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\n\"With 78 percent of the Union electorate casting ballots, Lincoln was reelected in an Electoral College landslide, 212 to McClellan's 21. The 55% popular vote for the president was the third largest in the nineteenth century, surpassed only by Jackson's first victory in 1828 and Grant's reelection in 1872. McClellan won only New Jersey, Delaware, and Kentucky. Republicans drew support from native-born farmers, skilled and professional workers, those of New England descent, younger voters, and military personnel. Democrats were strongest in the cities and among Irish- and German-Americans (the most populous immigrant groups). It has been estimated that Lincoln received 78% of the vote of Union soldiers and sailors. The figure was not necessary for his reelection, but was perhaps the margin of victory in a few close states and, more importantly, of great symbolic value. Republicans also gained seats in Congress to retain unassailable control, 149 to 42 in the House and 42 to 10 in the Senate; took back several state legislatures; and lost only the governorship of New Jersey (McClellan's home state).\"\nElection of 1864, Harpweek.com\nWhich of the following conclusions is best supported by the excerpt above?\nOptions:\nA.

The president of the bank has told us that most of the State banks exist by its forbearance.

Their power would be great whenever they might choose to exert it; but if this monopoly were regularly renewed every fifteen or twenty years on terms proposed by themselves, they might seldom in peace put forth their strength to influence elections or control the affairs of the nation.

It demands an end to poverty and racial injustice, to which we are totally committed in our time. But that is just the beginning. The Great Society is a place where every child can find knowledge to enrich his mind and to enlarge his talents. It is a place where leisure is a welcome chance to build and reflect, not a feared cause of boredom and restlessness. It is a place where the city of man serves not only the needs of the body and the demands of commerce but the desire for beauty and the hunger for community. It is a place where man can renew contact with nature. It is a place which honors creation for its own sake and for what it adds to the understanding of the race. It is a place where men are more concerned with the quality of their goals than the quantity of their goods. But most of all, the Great Society is not a safe harbor, a resting place, a final objective, a finished work. It is a challenge constantly renewed, beckoning us toward a destiny where the meaning of our lives matches the marvelous products of our labor.\"\nLyndon Johnson, Remarks at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 1964\nAll of the following were part of Johnson's Great Society program EXCEPT\nOptions:\nA. the Civil Rights Act of 1964\nB.

And, regardless of this formula of words made only for enlightened, self-governing people, do we owe no duty to the world?

But the payment of duties laid by an act of Parliament as regulations of commerce was never disputed. . . . An external tax is a duty laid on commodities imported; that duty is added to the first cost and other charges on the commodity, and, when it is offered for sale, makes a part of the price. If the people do not like it at that price, they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it. But an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it.\"\n\u2014Benjamin Franklin, Examination before Parliament, 1766\nThe policy described most immediately led to\nOptions:\nA. peace between Indian tribes and white settlers.\nB. the forced removal of the Cherokee from their homeland.\nC. the first Treaty of Fort Laramie, which guaranteed Indian possession of lands west of the Mississippi River.\nD. a negotiated settlement between the tribes of the Southeast and the U.S. government, by which the tribes were allowed to remain on their lands for ten years.\nAnswer:", "options": ["peace between Indian tribes and white settlers.", "the forced removal of the Cherokee from their homeland.", "the first Treaty of Fort Laramie, which guaranteed Indian possession of lands west of the Mississippi River.", "a negotiated settlement between the tribes of the Southeast and the U.S. government, by which the tribes were allowed to remain on their lands for ten years."], "probs": [[0.18182678520679474, 0.21154913306236267, 0.22277437150478363, 0.38384974002838135], [0.19375528395175934, 0.2436806559562683, 0.28891223669052124, 0.2736518383026123], [0.17936675250530243, 0.1898779422044754, 0.26950380206108093, 0.36125150322914124], [0.13642576336860657, 0.12322036921977997, 0.18551422655582428, 0.5548396110534668], [0.19350215792655945, 0.1834041178226471, 0.34538573026657104, 0.27770793437957764], [0.2113618701696396, 0.17947959899902344, 0.17038264870643616, 0.438775897026062], [0.23221087455749512, 0.22559651732444763, 0.21643996238708496, 0.3257526457309723], [0.23290953040122986, 0.246515691280365, 0.2746131122112274, 0.24596165120601654], [0.23918111622333527, 0.235941082239151, 0.23358860611915588, 0.2912892699241638], [0.2625085711479187, 0.23742027580738068, 0.23127004504203796, 0.2688010632991791], [0.2852110266685486, 0.2746489644050598, 0.22349606454372406, 0.21664392948150635], [0.28761056065559387, 0.25399941205978394, 0.17514093220233917, 0.2832491099834442], [0.19264431297779083, 0.18260100483894348, 0.3011055290699005, 0.32364916801452637], [0.1465015411376953, 0.12423436343669891, 0.18709972500801086, 0.5421643853187561], [0.22343659400939941, 0.23823843896389008, 0.2531084418296814, 0.28521645069122314], [0.24083997309207916, 0.2506951093673706, 0.2560119926929474, 0.2524529695510864], [0.21592707931995392, 0.1790333390235901, 0.22194141149520874, 0.3830982446670532], [0.19037121534347534, 0.1745941936969757, 0.45042112469673157, 0.1846134215593338], [0.2008897364139557, 0.16909170150756836, 0.41951417922973633, 0.21050436794757843], [0.24292537569999695, 0.18761387467384338, 0.16484606266021729, 0.40461465716362], [0.18331825733184814, 0.5628995895385742, 0.11973393708467484, 0.13404816389083862], [0.17585399746894836, 0.565894603729248, 0.1147957369685173, 0.1434556245803833], [0.24136431515216827, 0.15573135018348694, 0.2223341464996338, 0.3805701434612274], [0.2248370349407196, 0.15794335305690765, 0.4203914403915405, 0.196828231215477]], "ideal": "B"}}

Men who are honorable in their dealings with their white neighbors will cheat a Negro without feeling a single twinge of their honor. To kill a Negro they do not deem murder; to debauch a Negro woman they do not think fornication; to take the property away from a Negro they do not consider robbery. The people boast that when they get freedmen affairs in their own hands, to use their own classic expression, 'the niggers will catch hell.'\n\"The reason of all this is simple and manifest. The whites esteem the blacks their property by natural right, and however much they may admit that the individual relations of masters and slaves have been destroyed by the war and the President's emancipation proclamation, they still have an ingrained feeling that the blacks at large belong to the whites at large, and whenever opportunity serves they treat the colored people just as their profit, caprice or passion may dictate.\"\n\u2014Congressional testimony of Col.

Now, largely because of the troubled state of the world as a whole, civil liberties have disappeared in many other countries.\nIt is impossible, of course, to be at war and keep freedom of the press and freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. They disappear automatically. And so in many countries where ordinarily they were safe, today they have gone. In other countries, even before war came, not only freedom of the press and freedom of assembly, and freedom of speech disappeared, but freedom of religion disappeared.\nAnd so we know here in this country, we have a grave responsibility.

The president of the bank has told us that most of the State banks exist by its forbearance. Should its influence become concentrated, as it may under the operation of such an act as this, in the hands of a self-elected directory whose interests are identified with those of the foreign stockholders, will there not be cause to tremble for the purity of our elections in peace and for the independence of our country in war? Their power would be great whenever they might choose to exert it; but if this monopoly were regularly renewed every fifteen or twenty years on terms proposed by themselves, they might seldom in peace put forth their strength to influence elections or control the affairs of the nation.

This is a time of challenge to our interests and our values and it's a time that tests our wisdom and skills.\nAt this time in Iran, 50 Americans are still held captive, innocent victims of terrorism and anarchy. Also at this moment, massive Soviet troops are attempting to subjugate the fiercely independent and deeply religious people of Afghanistan. These two acts\u2014one of international terrorism and one of military aggression\u2014present a serious challenge to the United States of America and indeed to all the nations of the world. Together we will meet these threats to peace.\u2026\nThree basic developments have helped to shape our challenges: the steady growth and increased projection of Soviet military power beyond its own borders; the overwhelming dependence of the Western democracies on oil supplies from the Middle East; and the press of social and religious and economic and political change in the many nations of the developing world, exemplified by the revolution in Iran.\nEach of these factors is important in its own right. Each interacts with the others. All must be faced together, squarely and courageously. We will face these challenges, and we will meet them with the best that is in us. And we will not fail.\n\u2014Jimmy Carter, State of the Union Address, January 23, 1980\nWhich of the following has some of its roots in the conditions discussed by Jimmy Carter in this passage?\nOptions:\nA.

You should directly answer the question by choosing the correct option.\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\n\"With 78 percent of the Union electorate casting ballots, Lincoln was reelected in an Electoral College landslide, 212 to McClellan's 21. The 55% popular vote for the president was the third largest in the nineteenth century, surpassed only by Jackson's first victory in 1828 and Grant's reelection in 1872. McClellan won only New Jersey, Delaware, and Kentucky. Republicans drew support from native-born farmers, skilled and professional workers, those of New England descent, younger voters, and military personnel. Democrats were strongest in the cities and among Irish- and German-Americans (the most populous immigrant groups). It has been estimated that Lincoln received 78% of the vote of Union soldiers and sailors. The figure was not necessary for his reelection, but was perhaps the margin of victory in a few close states and, more importantly, of great symbolic value. Republicans also gained seats in Congress to retain unassailable control, 149 to 42 in the House and 42 to 10 in the Senate; took back several state legislatures; and lost only the governorship of New Jersey (McClellan's home state).\"\nElection of 1864, Harpweek.com\nWhich of the following provides the best explanation for why Radical Republicans opposed Lincoln in 1861?\nOptions:\nA.

The result was a distinctively Latin American form of rights discourse. Paolo Carozza traces the roots of that discourse to a distinctive application, and extension, of Thomistic moral philosophy to the injustices of Spanish conquests in the New World. The key figure in that development seems to have been Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas, a 16th-century Spanish bishop who condemned slavery and championed the cause of Indians on the basis of a natural right to liberty grounded in their membership in a single common humanity. 'All the peoples of the world are humans,' Las Casas wrote, and 'all the races of humankind are one.' According to Brian Tierney, Las Casas and other Spanish Dominican philosophers laid the groundwork for a doctrine of natural rights that was independent of religious revelation 'by drawing on a juridical tradition that derived natural rights and natural law from human rationality and free will, and by appealing to Aristotelian philosophy.'\"\nMary Ann Glendon, \"The Forgotten Crucible: The Latin American Influence on the Universal Human Rights Idea,\u201d 2003\nMaize cultivation among the native peoples of Mexico is most analogous to which of the following?\nOptions:\nA.

The result was a distinctively Latin American form of rights discourse. Paolo Carozza traces the roots of that discourse to a distinctive application, and extension, of Thomistic moral philosophy to the injustices of Spanish conquests in the New World. The key figure in that development seems to have been Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas, a 16th-century Spanish bishop who condemned slavery and championed the cause of Indians on the basis of a natural right to liberty grounded in their membership in a single common humanity. 'All the peoples of the world are humans,' Las Casas wrote, and 'all the races of humankind are one.' According to Brian Tierney, Las Casas and other Spanish Dominican philosophers laid the groundwork for a doctrine of natural rights that was independent of religious revelation 'by drawing on a juridical tradition that derived natural rights and natural law from human rationality and free will, and by appealing to Aristotelian philosophy.'\"\nMary Ann Glendon, \"The Forgotten Crucible: The Latin American Influence on the Universal Human Rights Idea,\u201d 2003\nWhich of the following presidents was most involved in Latin American politics in the twentieth century?\nOptions:\nA.

Jefferson was very tall, six feet two-and-a-half inches in height; sandy-complexioned; shy in manner, seeming cold; awkward in attitude, and with little in his bearing that suggested command.\u2026 His skin was thin, peeling from his face on exposure to the sun, giving it a tettered appearance. This sandy face, with hazel eyes and sunny aspect; this loose, shackling person; this rambling and often brilliant conversation, belonged to the controlling influences of American history, more necessary to the story than three-fourths of the official papers, which only hid the truth. Jefferson's personality during these eight years appeared to be the government, and impressed itself, like that of Bonaparte, although by a different process, on the mind of the nation. In the village simplicity of Washington, he was more than a king, for he was alone in social as well as in political pre-eminence. Except the British Legation, no house in Washington was open to general society; the whole mass of politicians, even the Federalists, were dependent on Jefferson and \"The Palace\" for amusement; and if they refused to go there, they \"lived like bears, brutalized and stupefied.\"\n\u2014Henry Adams, History of the United States During the Administration of Thomas Jefferson, 1889\nAs the great-grandson of President John Adams, the historian Henry Adams might have been expected to be which of the following?\nOptions:\nA.

The right of judging, in such cases, is an essential attribute of sovereignty, of which the States cannot be divested without losing their sovereignty itself, and being reduced to a subordinate corporate condition. In fact, to divide power, and to give to one of the parties the exclusive right of judging of the portion allotted to each, is, in reality, not to divide it at all; and to reserve such exclusive right to the General Government (it matters not by what department to be exercised), is to convert it, in fact, into a great consolidated government, with unlimited powers, and to divest the States, in reality, of all their rights, It is impossible to understand the force of terms, and to deny so plain a conclusion.\"\n\u2014John C.

They propose to sacrifice our homes, lives, and children on the altar of mammon; to destroy the multitude in order to secure corruption funds from the millionaires.\n\"Assembled on the anniversary of the birthday of the nation, and filled with the spirit of the grand general and chief who established our independence, we seek to restore the government of the Republic to the hands of 'the plain people,' with which class it originated.

The right of judging, in such cases, is an essential attribute of sovereignty, of which the States cannot be divested without losing their sovereignty itself, and being reduced to a subordinate corporate condition. In fact, to divide power, and to give to one of the parties the exclusive right of judging of the portion allotted to each, is, in reality, not to divide it at all; and to reserve such exclusive right to the General Government (it matters not by what department to be exercised), is to convert it, in fact, into a great consolidated government, with unlimited powers, and to divest the States, in reality, of all their rights, It is impossible to understand the force of terms, and to deny so plain a conclusion.\"\n\u2014John C.

It demands an end to poverty and racial injustice, to which we are totally committed in our time. But that is just the beginning. The Great Society is a place where every child can find knowledge to enrich his mind and to enlarge his talents. It is a place where leisure is a welcome chance to build and reflect, not a feared cause of boredom and restlessness. It is a place where the city of man serves not only the needs of the body and the demands of commerce but the desire for beauty and the hunger for community. It is a place where man can renew contact with nature. It is a place which honors creation for its own sake and for what it adds to the understanding of the race. It is a place where men are more concerned with the quality of their goals than the quantity of their goods. But most of all, the Great Society is not a safe harbor, a resting place, a final objective, a finished work. It is a challenge constantly renewed, beckoning us toward a destiny where the meaning of our lives matches the marvelous products of our labor.\"\nLyndon Johnson, Remarks at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 1964\nAlong with his goals of establishing a Great Society, Johnson was also engaged in which of the following initiatives?\nOptions:\nA.

Dangers and difficulties, instead of deterring, seemed to have a charm in his eyes.\u2026 He conceived, at the first moment of his landing in Mexico, the design of its conquest. When he saw the strength of its civilization, he was not turned from his purpose.\u2026 This spirit of knight-errantry might lead us to undervalue his talents as a general, and to regard him merely in the light of a lucky adventurer. But this would be doing him injustice; for Cortes was certainly a great general, if that man be one, who performs great achievements with the resources which his own genius has created. There is probably no instance in history, where so vast an enterprise has been achieved by means apparently so inadequate.\u2026 He brought together the most miscellaneous collection of mercenaries who ever fought under one standard: adventurers from Cuba and the Isles, craving for gold; hidalgos, who came from the old country to win laurels; \u2026 wild tribes of the natives from all parts of the country, who had been sworn enemies from their cradles, and who had met only to cut one another's throats, and to procure victims for sacrifice; men, in short, differing in race, in language, and in interests, with scarcely anything in common among them. Yet this motley congregation was assembled in one camp, compelled to bend to the will of one man, to consort together in harmony, to breathe, as it were, one spirit, and to move on a common principle of action!\n\u2014William Hickling Prescott, History of the Conquest of Mexico, 1843\nAs Prescott makes clear in the passage above, an important reason for Cortes's military success was which of the following?\nOptions:\nA.

It demands an end to poverty and racial injustice, to which we are totally committed in our time. But that is just the beginning. The Great Society is a place where every child can find knowledge to enrich his mind and to enlarge his talents. It is a place where leisure is a welcome chance to build and reflect, not a feared cause of boredom and restlessness. It is a place where the city of man serves not only the needs of the body and the demands of commerce but the desire for beauty and the hunger for community. It is a place where man can renew contact with nature. It is a place which honors creation for its own sake and for what it adds to the understanding of the race. It is a place where men are more concerned with the quality of their goals than the quantity of their goods. But most of all, the Great Society is not a safe harbor, a resting place, a final objective, a finished work. It is a challenge constantly renewed, beckoning us toward a destiny where the meaning of our lives matches the marvelous products of our labor.\"\nLyndon Johnson, Remarks at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 1964\nJohnson's Great Society most represented an extension of which of the following initiatives?\nOptions:\nA.

Jefferson was very tall, six feet two-and-a-half inches in height; sandy-complexioned; shy in manner, seeming cold; awkward in attitude, and with little in his bearing that suggested command.\u2026 His skin was thin, peeling from his face on exposure to the sun, giving it a tettered appearance. This sandy face, with hazel eyes and sunny aspect; this loose, shackling person; this rambling and often brilliant conversation, belonged to the controlling influences of American history, more necessary to the story than three-fourths of the official papers, which only hid the truth. Jefferson's personality during these eight years appeared to be the government, and impressed itself, like that of Bonaparte, although by a different process, on the mind of the nation. In the village simplicity of Washington, he was more than a king, for he was alone in social as well as in political pre-eminence. Except the British Legation, no house in Washington was open to general society; the whole mass of politicians, even the Federalists, were dependent on Jefferson and \"The Palace\" for amusement; and if they refused to go there, they \"lived like bears, brutalized and stupefied.\"\n\u2014Henry Adams, History of the United States During the Administration of Thomas Jefferson, 1889\nAlthough Jefferson believed that government should be small and limited, once in office he\nOptions:\nA. created a spoils system that bloated the size of the bureaucracy\nB. laid the foundations of the welfare state\nC. called for an ambitious program of road building and public works\nD. vigorously exercised federal power in foreign affairs\nAnswer:", "options": ["created a spoils system that bloated the size of the bureaucracy", "laid the foundations of the welfare state", "called for an ambitious program of road building and public works", "vigorously exercised federal power in foreign affairs"], "probs": [[0.2893142104148865, 0.17868375778198242, 0.22909992933273315, 0.30290213227272034], [0.3250694274902344, 0.20714832842350006, 0.24997255206108093, 0.2178097367286682], [0.2877775728702545, 0.2779119908809662, 0.14461341500282288, 0.2896970212459564], [0.2730399966239929, 0.2897329032421112, 0.21992211043834686, 0.21730494499206543], [0.31523460149765015, 0.31391963362693787, 0.15973985195159912, 0.21110589802265167], [0.3036230802536011, 0.2977159917354584, 0.17175577580928802, 0.22690512239933014], [0.2166186422109604, 0.29989930987358093, 0.19267992675304413, 0.29080215096473694], [0.21990028023719788, 0.3371506333351135, 0.2254716455936432, 0.21747739613056183], [0.2220780849456787, 0.3569324016571045, 0.1599406898021698, 0.2610488831996918], [0.18051256239414215, 0.3816024661064148, 0.24157264828681946, 0.19631241261959076], [0.2007453441619873, 0.4210927188396454, 0.17318494617938995, 0.20497699081897736], [0.1888098567724228, 0.42831456661224365, 0.14823777973651886, 0.2346377968788147], [0.3494471311569214, 0.22802485525608063, 0.13993287086486816, 0.28259512782096863], [0.3458571135997772, 0.22745198011398315, 0.20202000439167023, 0.22467093169689178], [0.35652777552604675, 0.2020597606897354, 0.16440244019031525, 0.27701008319854736], [0.326225608587265, 0.21288560330867767, 0.23179438710212708, 0.22909440100193024], [0.35250964760780334, 0.2932983934879303, 0.1505122184753418, 0.20367972552776337], [0.32456448674201965, 0.3258066177368164, 0.12700903415679932, 0.22261987626552582], [0.5026060342788696, 0.20151212811470032, 0.11729114502668381, 0.1785905808210373], [0.4441860020160675, 0.2100490927696228, 0.1364196538925171, 0.20934531092643738], [0.5411980152130127, 0.15993742644786835, 0.12931495904922485, 0.1695495843887329], [0.5199820399284363, 0.15859974920749664, 0.12923140823841095, 0.1921868473291397], [0.48099732398986816, 0.19906967878341675, 0.13342680037021637, 0.18650619685649872], [0.5195983648300171, 0.18678927421569824, 0.1045209988951683, 0.18909139931201935]], "ideal": "D"}}

I think conservatism is really a misnomer just as liberalism is a misnomer for the liberals\u2014if we were back in the days of the Revolution, so-called conservatives today would be the Liberals and the liberals would be the Tories. The basis of conservatism is a desire for less government interference or less centralized authority or more individual freedom and this is a pretty general description also of what libertarianism is. Now, I can't say that I will agree with all the things that the present group who call themselves Libertarians in the sense of a party say, because I think that like in any political movement there are shades, and there are libertarians who are almost over at the point of wanting no government at all or anarchy. I believe there are legitimate government functions. There is a legitimate need in an orderly society for some government to maintain freedom or we will have tyranny by individuals. The strongest man on the block will run the neighborhood. We have government to ensure that we don't each one of us have to carry a club to defend ourselves. But again, I stand on my statement that I think that libertarianism and conservatism are traveling the same path.\"\nRonald Reagan, Interview published in Reason magazine, 1975\nAll of the following are factors that contributed to the prominence of conservatism in the late 1970s and 1980s EXCEPT\nOptions:\nA. the success of the Libertarian party in national elections\nB. the growth of religious fundamentalism\nC. perceived economic and foreign policy failures under President Carter\nD. social changes following the Civil Rights movement and Vietnam War\nAnswer:", "options": ["the success of the Libertarian party in national elections", "the growth of religious fundamentalism", "perceived economic and foreign policy failures under President Carter", "social changes following the Civil Rights movement and Vietnam War"], "probs": [[0.21219970285892487, 0.2264786660671234, 0.3341369330883026, 0.22718465328216553], [0.2848113179206848, 0.25416338443756104, 0.19398488104343414, 0.2670404016971588], [0.251491516828537, 0.45776131749153137, 0.1222771480679512, 0.16847006976604462], [0.25568681955337524, 0.45469000935554504, 0.12626951932907104, 0.16335368156433105], [0.294833779335022, 0.2590247094631195, 0.1885557770729065, 0.257585734128952], [0.21462315320968628, 0.24782414734363556, 0.3300625681877136, 0.20749005675315857], [0.21872462332248688, 0.2525443136692047, 0.3087060749530792, 0.22002500295639038], [0.2805674970149994, 0.2772245705127716, 0.18524618446826935, 0.25696173310279846], [0.2643771171569824, 0.4053323566913605, 0.14463241398334503, 0.18565815687179565], [0.27212709188461304, 0.41726967692375183, 0.13660016655921936, 0.1740030199289322], [0.2987162172794342, 0.262442409992218, 0.1837824136018753, 0.2550589144229889], [0.22786729037761688, 0.2531140148639679, 0.3069508969783783, 0.21206781268119812], [0.4177694618701935, 0.2422538697719574, 0.15810789167881012, 0.181868776679039], [0.42580345273017883, 0.23741555213928223, 0.15862461924552917, 0.17815637588500977], [0.4006999731063843, 0.2251894176006317, 0.17325903475284576, 0.20085158944129944], [0.4257558584213257, 0.22306418418884277, 0.15989767014980316, 0.19128230214118958], [0.43083304166793823, 0.247872993350029, 0.15193700790405273, 0.16935697197914124], [0.43248945474624634, 0.2450258731842041, 0.15373501181602478, 0.1687496155500412], [0.2812710106372833, 0.24133992195129395, 0.190019428730011, 0.28736966848373413], [0.20999082922935486, 0.20889133214950562, 0.3546682894229889, 0.22644954919815063], [0.27472037076950073, 0.24706844985485077, 0.18851836025714874, 0.28969281911849976], [0.20312069356441498, 0.2327398806810379, 0.33254268765449524, 0.2315967082977295], [0.2637339234352112, 0.4238010048866272, 0.1343935877084732, 0.17807143926620483], [0.2546941041946411, 0.4357817471027374, 0.1277938336133957, 0.18173032999038696]], "ideal": "A"}}

It is well to notice this advantage\u2014the advantage of complete organization. They are organized; and yet were not at the pains of creating their organizations. The State governments, where the system of slavery exists, are complete slavery organizations. The church organizations in those States are equally at the service of slavery; while the Federal Government, with its army and navy, from the chief magistracy in Washington, to the Supreme Court, and thence to the chief marshalship at New York, is pledged to support, defend, and propagate the crying curse of human bondage.

It demands an end to poverty and racial injustice, to which we are totally committed in our time. But that is just the beginning. The Great Society is a place where every child can find knowledge to enrich his mind and to enlarge his talents. It is a place where leisure is a welcome chance to build and reflect, not a feared cause of boredom and restlessness. It is a place where the city of man serves not only the needs of the body and the demands of commerce but the desire for beauty and the hunger for community. It is a place where man can renew contact with nature. It is a place which honors creation for its own sake and for what it adds to the understanding of the race. It is a place where men are more concerned with the quality of their goals than the quantity of their goods. But most of all, the Great Society is not a safe harbor, a resting place, a final objective, a finished work. It is a challenge constantly renewed, beckoning us toward a destiny where the meaning of our lives matches the marvelous products of our labor.\"\nLyndon Johnson, Remarks at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 1964\nWhich one of the following was an unintended consequence of the liberal successes of the 1960s?\nOptions:\nA.

Sir, we have done everything that could be done, to avert the storm which is now coming on. We have petitioned; we have remonstrated; we have supplicated; we have prostrated ourselves before the throne, and have implored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and Parliament. Our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances have produced additional violence and insult; our supplications have been disregarded; and we have been spurned, with contempt, from the foot of the throne. In vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation. There is no longer any room for hope.\u2026 It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry, Peace, Peace, but there is no peace. The war is actually begun! The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our brethren are already in the field! Why stand we here idle? What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God!

It stands for a hundred like her own. She averages three dollars a week. Pay is $1.50 for her room; for breakfast she has a cup of coffee; lunch she cannot afford. One meal a day is her allowance. This woman is young, she is pretty. She has \"the world before her.\" Is it anything less than a miracle if she is guilty of nothing less than the \"early and improvident marriage,\" against which moralists exclaim as one of the prolific causes of the distresses of the poor? Almost any door might seem to offer a welcome escape from such slavery as this. \"I feel so much healthier since I got three square meals a day,\" said a lodger in one of the Girls' Homes. Two young sewing-girls came in seeking domestic service, so that they might get enough to eat. They had been only half-fed for some time, and starvation had driven them to the one door at which the pride of the American-born girl will not permit her to knock, though poverty be the price of her independence.\n\u2014Jacob Riis, How the Other Half Lives, 1890\nRiis's work as an investigator of the lives of the poor can most directly be associated with which of the following?\nOptions:\nA.
