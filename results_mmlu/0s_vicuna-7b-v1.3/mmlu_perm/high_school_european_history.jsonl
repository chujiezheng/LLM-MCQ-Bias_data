If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: \"I do not know him\"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, \"He is a man I never see\"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.\nNo one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.\nHe loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him. Motives of policy had something to do with this; by making expensive habits the fashion, and, for people in a certain position, a necessity, he compelled his courtiers to live beyond their income, and gradually reduced them to depend on his bounty for the means of subsistence.\n\u2014Duke Saint-Simon, Memoirs of Louis XIV and His Court and His Regency, c. 1750\nWhich of the following is the best explanation of the bias found in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you.

You should directly answer the question by choosing the correct option.\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nThe pair of excerpts below is written by explorer Christopher Columbus and the Dominican Bishop of Chiapas, Mexico, Bartholomew de las Casas.\nSource 1\nIndians would give whatever the seller required. . . . Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.\n\u2014Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493\nSource 2\nIt was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.\n\u2014Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542\nWhich of the following would best account for the differences between the interactions of the Spaniards and the natives as described in the two accounts?\nOptions:\nA.

He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that?

Of all of those acquirements, which more particularly belong to the feminine character, there are none which take a higher rank, in our estimation, than such as enter into a knowledge of household duties; for on these are perpetually dependent the happiness, comfort, and well-being of the family.\nIsabella Beeton, Book of Household Management, 1861\nFrom the passage, one may infer that the subject of Beeton's book was\nOptions:\nA. the role of women in army regiments\nB. the running of a school for domestic servants\nC. the running of a school for girls\nD. the role of a woman in running her own domestic household\nAnswer:", "options": ["the role of women in army regiments", "the running of a school for domestic servants", "the running of a school for girls", "the role of a woman in running her own domestic household"], "probs": [[0.009724369272589684, 0.02227145992219448, 0.0053722551092505455, 0.9626319408416748], [0.012348194606602192, 0.018543170765042305, 0.9663952589035034, 0.002713453257456422], [0.007048359140753746, 0.008375496603548527, 0.01588895358145237, 0.9686872363090515], [0.008239386603236198, 0.007161343935877085, 0.9832538366317749, 0.001345484983175993], [0.006470855791121721, 0.9911931753158569, 0.0007494992460124195, 0.001586458063684404], [0.006271569523960352, 0.9911620616912842, 0.0006824107258580625, 0.0018838949035853148], [0.010584739036858082, 0.01381318923085928, 0.006422162055969238, 0.9691799283027649], [0.016452129930257797, 0.009089048951864243, 0.9719350337982178, 0.002523865317925811], [0.01177245657891035, 0.01713745854794979, 0.004909208044409752, 0.9661808609962463], [0.028714606538414955, 0.015375674702227116, 0.9516398310661316, 0.004269841127097607], [0.020228873938322067, 0.9750940799713135, 0.0017150337807834148, 0.0029619927518069744], [0.019002646207809448, 0.9750370979309082, 0.002036360325291753, 0.003923773765563965], [0.010384727269411087, 0.007843762636184692, 0.031013326719403267, 0.9507580995559692], [0.012309824116528034, 0.007127346005290747, 0.9786144495010376, 0.0019483478972688317], [0.011603563092648983, 0.03205208107829094, 0.0040748449973762035, 0.952269434928894], [0.03426579385995865, 0.032707564532756805, 0.9268803000450134, 0.006146263796836138], [0.014200779609382153, 0.980529248714447, 0.0013855932047590613, 0.003884418634697795], [0.013162406161427498, 0.9826401472091675, 0.001304416568018496, 0.002892922144383192], [0.9714975357055664, 0.02357642911374569, 0.002195336390286684, 0.002730774460360408], [0.9700474739074707, 0.024287687614560127, 0.0019957791082561016, 0.00366908498108387], [0.9744930267333984, 0.020870160311460495, 0.001854548929259181, 0.002782244700938463], [0.9728366732597351, 0.02183508314192295, 0.002130987588316202, 0.0031971780117601156], [0.963324785232544, 0.025675227865576744, 0.0019821757450699806, 0.009017808362841606], [0.9751172661781311, 0.020560136064887047, 0.0018269795691594481, 0.0024957149289548397]], "ideal": "D"}}

You should directly answer the question by choosing the correct option.\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nFirst we must remark that the cosmos is spherical in form, partly because this form being a perfect whole requiring no joints, is the most complete of all, partly because it makes the most capacious form, which is best suited to contain and preserve everything; or again because all the constituent parts of the universe, that is the sun, moon and the planets appear in this form; or because everything strives to attain this form, as appears in the case of drops of water and other fluid bodies if they attempt to define themselves. So no one will doubt that this form belongs to the heavenly bodies. \u2026\nThat the earth is also spherical is therefore beyond question, because it presses from all sides upon its center. Although by reason of the elevations of the mountains and the depressions of the valleys a perfect circle cannot be understood, yet this does not affect the general spherical nature of the earth. \u2026\nAs it has been already shown that the earth has the form of a sphere, we must consider whether a movement also coincides with this form, and what place the earth holds in the universe. \u2026 The great majority of authors of course agree that the earth stands still in the center of the universe, and consider it inconceivable and ridiculous to suppose the opposite. But if the matter is carefully weighed, it will be seen that the question is not yet settled and therefore by no means to be regarded lightly. Every change of place which is observed is due, namely, to a movement of the observed object or of the observer, or to movements of both. \u2026 Now it is from the earth that the revolution of the heavens is observed and it is produced for our eyes. Therefore if the earth undergoes no movement this movement must take place in everything outside of the earth, but in the opposite direction than if everything on the earth moved, and of this kind is the daily revolution. So this appears to affect the whole universe, that is, everything outside the earth with the single exception of the earth itself. If, however, one should admit that this movement was not peculiar to the heavens, but that the earth revolved from west to east, and if this was carefully considered in regard to the apparent rising and setting of the sun, the moon and the stars, it would be discovered that this was the real situation.\"\nNicolas Copernicus, The Revolutions of the Heavenly Bodies, 1543\nFrom the passage, one may say that Copernicus's argument for a spherical cosmos was based on\nOptions:\nA. observation and induction\nB. ancient textual authority\nC. experimentation\nD. deduction from first principles\nAnswer:", "options": ["observation and induction", "ancient textual authority", "experimentation", "deduction from first principles"], "probs": [[0.2647286653518677, 0.2652233839035034, 0.1398659348487854, 0.3301820158958435], [0.3597482442855835, 0.27198100090026855, 0.229400634765625, 0.13887004554271698], [0.24063679575920105, 0.19074507057666779, 0.22314701974391937, 0.3454711139202118], [0.2431802600622177, 0.17268472909927368, 0.36590859293937683, 0.2182263731956482], [0.3725643455982208, 0.4227280914783478, 0.08733827620744705, 0.11736929416656494], [0.3109282851219177, 0.46722760796546936, 0.06036419793963432, 0.1614799052476883], [0.1474885791540146, 0.4922664165496826, 0.09256230294704437, 0.26768261194229126], [0.18002700805664062, 0.49813854694366455, 0.17236532270908356, 0.14946907758712769], [0.1212296187877655, 0.12539152801036835, 0.43827980756759644, 0.3150990605354309], [0.13554522395133972, 0.14691036939620972, 0.38146668672561646, 0.3360777497291565], [0.1890658587217331, 0.26318255066871643, 0.33309322595596313, 0.21465842425823212], [0.1420809030532837, 0.3469747006893158, 0.12373769283294678, 0.38720670342445374], [0.10574890673160553, 0.41271308064460754, 0.19806638360023499, 0.28347164392471313], [0.10815280675888062, 0.21548084914684296, 0.4709128737449646, 0.20545338094234467], [0.11888387054204941, 0.19044709205627441, 0.36177971959114075, 0.32888931035995483], [0.12669417262077332, 0.1997613161802292, 0.4577518701553345, 0.21579261124134064], [0.07769189774990082, 0.6616958975791931, 0.12833769619464874, 0.13227446377277374], [0.08103194832801819, 0.6486341953277588, 0.11638915538787842, 0.15394464135169983], [0.18895232677459717, 0.6111003756523132, 0.07775579392910004, 0.12219145894050598], [0.1689327508211136, 0.6384127140045166, 0.052423153072595596, 0.14023138582706451], [0.25725507736206055, 0.20718169212341309, 0.3316810429096222, 0.2038821578025818], [0.19215579330921173, 0.22870321571826935, 0.16479507088661194, 0.4143458604812622], [0.18241587281227112, 0.1445700228214264, 0.44565582275390625, 0.22735832631587982], [0.1868254542350769, 0.19020918011665344, 0.1873284876346588, 0.43563687801361084]], "ideal": "A"}}

Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.\n\u2014Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493\nSource 2\nIt was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive.

As the present sciences are useless for the discovery of effects, so the present system of logic is useless for the discovery of the sciences.\nXIX. There are and can exist but two ways of investigating and discovering truth. The one hurries on rapidly from the senses and particulars to the most general axioms, and from them, as principles and their supposed indisputable truth, derives and discovers the intermediate axioms. This is the way now in use. The other constructs its axioms from the senses and particulars, by ascending continually and gradually, till it finally arrives at the most general axioms, which is the true but unattempted way.\nXXII. Each of these two ways begins from the senses and particulars, and ends in the greatest generalities&\u2026\nXXXVI.

Those who have not witnessed it with their own eyes cannot imagine how great it is. Not a day passes but at least 200 people die of famine in the two provinces. We certify to having ourselves seen herds, not of cattle, but of men and women, wandering about the fields between Rheims and Rh\u00e9tel, turning up the earth like pigs to find a few roots; and as they can only find rotten ones, and not half enough of them, they become so weak that they have not strength left to seek food. The parish priest at Boult, whose letter we enclose, tells us he has buried three of his parishioners who died of hunger. The rest subsisted on chopped straw mixed with earth, of which they composed a food which cannot be called bread.

You should directly answer the question by choosing the correct option.\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\n\"In 1500 that work appeared which Erasmus had written after his misfortune at Dover, and had dedicated to Mountjoy, the Adagiorum Collectanea. It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.\nUntil this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.\nErasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all.\"\nJohan Huizinga, twentieth-century Dutch philosopher, Erasmus and the Age of Reformation, 1924\nAccording to Huizinga, Erasmus's legacy was more significant than that of earlier humanists because\nOptions:\nA. he had more support from the Church\nB. he wrote in a language that was understandable to the masses, unlike his predecessors\nC. he wrote exclusively about religious matters\nD. he valued educating the masses more than his predecessors had\nAnswer:", "options": ["he had more support from the Church", "he wrote in a language that was understandable to the masses, unlike his predecessors", "he wrote exclusively about religious matters", "he valued educating the masses more than his predecessors had"], "probs": [[0.03256035968661308, 0.19649873673915863, 0.016903532668948174, 0.7540373206138611], [0.09559275209903717, 0.26819100975990295, 0.542079508304596, 0.0941368043422699], [0.021737996488809586, 0.048257481306791306, 0.08738574385643005, 0.8426188826560974], [0.02339732088148594, 0.0368216410279274, 0.9067764282226562, 0.03300456330180168], [0.01998690329492092, 0.9486011862754822, 0.00691315857693553, 0.024498797953128815], [0.022094091400504112, 0.8694829344749451, 0.007764707785099745, 0.10065826773643494], [0.07749461382627487, 0.16418948769569397, 0.032844021916389465, 0.7254718542098999], [0.21528494358062744, 0.1480010598897934, 0.5333947539329529, 0.10331927239894867], [0.0757918432354927, 0.15565328299999237, 0.03640208765864372, 0.7321528196334839], [0.12328722327947617, 0.11585088819265366, 0.6883684396743774, 0.07249344885349274], [0.5280671119689941, 0.3685874044895172, 0.028449583798646927, 0.07489583641290665], [0.46012818813323975, 0.4321732819080353, 0.02898377552628517, 0.0787147507071495], [0.02368268370628357, 0.050956230610609055, 0.08943906426429749, 0.8359220623970032], [0.027116354554891586, 0.04072004556655884, 0.8989299535751343, 0.03323367238044739], [0.034391939640045166, 0.17478956282138824, 0.018712112680077553, 0.772106409072876], [0.05761970207095146, 0.11826354265213013, 0.7716402411460876, 0.05247647687792778], [0.021532678976655006, 0.9020184874534607, 0.006890184246003628, 0.06955862790346146], [0.016217924654483795, 0.9579192399978638, 0.005352928768843412, 0.020509818568825722], [0.7407715320587158, 0.16523724794387817, 0.03414060175418854, 0.05985058471560478], [0.49867311120033264, 0.17233198881149292, 0.03562245890498161, 0.2933724820613861], [0.7373566031455994, 0.1806374043226242, 0.023352738469839096, 0.0586533397436142], [0.7217177152633667, 0.1941695213317871, 0.023955363780260086, 0.06015739589929581], [0.48308321833610535, 0.1833469122648239, 0.04034746438264847, 0.2932223081588745], [0.6948383450508118, 0.19287268817424774, 0.042427826672792435, 0.06986111402511597]], "ideal": "D"}}

I was so long in delivering it that the Iman began to get angry, and seeing that I was a Christian he called out for help. They carried me before the cadi, who ordered me a hundred lashes on the soles of the feet and sent me to the galleys. I was chained to the very same galley and the same bench as the young Baron.

The hope of the past times was gone, the struggles of mankind for many ages had produced nothing but this sordid, aimless, ugly confusion; the immediate future seemed to me likely to intensify all the present evils by sweeping away the last survivals of the days before the dull squalor of civilization had settled down on the world.\nThis was a bad lookout indeed, and, if I may mention myself as a personality and not as a mere type, especially so to a man of my disposition, careless of metaphysics and religion, as well as of scientific analysis, but with a deep love of the earth and the life on it, and a passion for the history of the past of mankind.\nWilliam Morris, How I Became a Socialist, 1896\nFrom the passage, one may infer that Morris\nOptions:\nA. chose to become a socialist because he was appalled by the great waste of resources and general misery caused by modern society\nB. chose to become a socialist because of the persuasiveness of Marx's arguments\nC. rejected socialism because it produced nothing but ugly confusion\nD. rejected socialism because of a deep love of the Earth and the life on it\nAnswer:", "options": ["chose to become a socialist because he was appalled by the great waste of resources and general misery caused by modern society", "chose to become a socialist because of the persuasiveness of Marx's arguments", "rejected socialism because it produced nothing but ugly confusion", "rejected socialism because of a deep love of the Earth and the life on it"], "probs": [[0.47577959299087524, 0.18922725319862366, 0.05511120706796646, 0.2798819839954376], [0.6274698972702026, 0.203639417886734, 0.04338755086064339, 0.12550313770771027], [0.49325117468833923, 0.17582803964614868, 0.06679823994636536, 0.26412251591682434], [0.6787844300270081, 0.17156608402729034, 0.05488209053874016, 0.09476740658283234], [0.675545334815979, 0.14604341983795166, 0.06285161525011063, 0.11555963009595871], [0.7195225358009338, 0.14842914044857025, 0.05133089795708656, 0.08071742951869965], [0.0063972813077270985, 0.9799633622169495, 0.002752997213974595, 0.010886352509260178], [0.008244826458394527, 0.9836670160293579, 0.002053669421002269, 0.006034578662365675], [0.02202407829463482, 0.030583901330828667, 0.9224311709403992, 0.024960793554782867], [0.03377649188041687, 0.061201002448797226, 0.059295594692230225, 0.8457269072532654], [0.03662768751382828, 0.06232525780797005, 0.8742431998252869, 0.026803819462656975], [0.018667778000235558, 0.041442565619945526, 0.02473415806889534, 0.9151555895805359], [0.08016249537467957, 0.7609822750091553, 0.05261014401912689, 0.10624511539936066], [0.05971704423427582, 0.8642538785934448, 0.02651246450841427, 0.049516692757606506], [0.023641696199774742, 0.024017835035920143, 0.9301273226737976, 0.02221321314573288], [0.06917545944452286, 0.10719316452741623, 0.06706608831882477, 0.7565652132034302], [0.06375008076429367, 0.035214442759752274, 0.8401958346366882, 0.060839664191007614], [0.05893746018409729, 0.08186348527669907, 0.05713626742362976, 0.8020628094673157], [0.01806040108203888, 0.9267231822013855, 0.019845226779580116, 0.03537118807435036], [0.0176434013992548, 0.9340496063232422, 0.015336243435740471, 0.032970692962408066], [0.021954823285341263, 0.02062980830669403, 0.9340391755104065, 0.02337614633142948], [0.02431800402700901, 0.039494894444942474, 0.03651043772697449, 0.8996766805648804], [0.039065659046173096, 0.029962599277496338, 0.8758693933486938, 0.05510220676660538], [0.023421091958880424, 0.04446845501661301, 0.02416825480759144, 0.9079421758651733]], "ideal": "A"}}

Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.\n\u2014Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493\nSource 2\nIt was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.\n\u2014Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542\nWhich of the following motives for exploration does de las Casas seem to be criticizing in Source 2?\nOptions:\nA.

The genius of Napoleon is astounding. All branches of human knowledge seemed alike familiar to his gigantic mind. His conversations at St. Helena, scattered through the numerous and voluminous memorials of those who gleaned them, are replete with intensest interest. During the long agony of his imprisonment and his death, he conversed with perfect freedom upon the events of his marvelous career, and upon all those subjects or morals, politics, and religion, which most deeply concern the welfare of our race.

Nor were there just three such stars; four wanderers complete their revolutions about Jupiter, and of their alterations as observed more precisely later on we shall give a description here. Also I measured the distances between them by means of the telescope. . . .\nSuch are the observations concerning the four Medicean planets recently first discovered by me, and although from this data their periods have not yet been reconstructed in numerical form, it is legitimate at least to put in evidence some facts worthy of note. Above all, since they sometimes follow and sometimes precede Jupiter by the same intervals, and they remain within very limited distances either to east or west of Jupiter, accompanying that planet in both its retrograde and direct movements in a constant manner, no one can doubt that they complete their revolutions about Jupiter and at the same time effect all together a twelve-year period about the center of the universe.\n\u2014Galileo Galilei, 1610\nWhich of the following Polish thinkers was most likely the person whose ideas convinced Galileo to have written the statement above?\nOptions:\nA.

One would find it hard to imagine how the laws of movement cause such frightful disasters in the best of possible worlds. A hundred thousand ants, our fellows, crushed all at once in our ant-hill, and half of them perishing, no doubt in unspeakable agony, beneath the wreckage from which they cannot be drawn. Families ruined all over Europe, the fortune of a hundred businessmen, your compatriots, swallowed up in the ruins of Lisbon. What a wretched gamble is the game of human life! What will the preachers say, especially if the palace of the Inquisition is still standing? I flatter myself that at least the reverend father inquisitors have been crushed like others.

I have instanced Louis the XVI, who loved the trade of locksmith; an Infanta of Spain preferred that of shoemaker; a certain king of Denmark gratified himself by manufacturing syringes; the former king of Naples loved to sell the fish he had caught in the market-place himself; the prince of Parma, whom Condillac had trained in metaphysical subtitles, in the understanding of intuition, of cognition, had no taste but for the occupation of church-warden and lay-brother.\nThe great majority of wealthy children would follow these plebeian tastes, if civilized education did not oppose the development of them; and if the filthiness of the workshops and the coarseness of the workmen did not arouse a repugnance stronger than the attraction.

The success of the revolution discredited conservative ideas; the failure of the revolution discredited liberal ideas. After it, nothing remained but the idea of Force, and this idea stood at the helm of German history from then on. For the first time since 1521, the German people stepped on to the centre of the German stage only to miss their cue once more. German history reached its turning-point and failed to turn. This was the fateful essence of 1848.\nA. J. P. Taylor, The Course of German History, 1945\nWhy might it be important to note that Taylor was writing his analysis in 1945?\nOptions:\nA.

You should directly answer the question by choosing the correct option.\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\n\"In 1500 that work appeared which Erasmus had written after his misfortune at Dover, and had dedicated to Mountjoy, the Adagiorum Collectanea. It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.\nUntil this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.\nErasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all.\"\nJohan Huizinga, twentieth-century Dutch philosopher, Erasmus and the Age of Reformation, 1924\nThe type of humanism attributed to Erasmus in this passage is most similar to what Southern Renaissance movement?\nOptions:\nA.

We then discoursed of the circulation of the blood, the valves in the veins, the venae lactae, the lymphatic vessels, the Copernican hypothesis, the nature of comets and new stars, the satellites of Jupiter, the oval shape (as it then appeared) of Saturn, the spots in the sun, and its turning on its own axis, the inequalities and selenography of the moon, the several phases of Venus and Mercury, the improvement of telescopes, and grinding of glasses for that purpose, the weight of air, the possibility, or impossibility of vacuities, and nature's abhorrence thereof, the Torricellian experiment in quicksilver, the descent of heavy bodies, and the degrees of acceleration therein; and divers other things of like nature. Some of which were then but new discoveries, and others not so generally known and embraced, as now they are. \u2026\nWe barred all discourses of divinity, of state affairs, and of news, other than what concerned our business of Philosophy. These meetings we removed soon after to the Bull Head in Cheapside, and in term-time to Gresham College, where we met weekly at Mr. Foster's lecture (then Astronomy Professor there), and, after the lecture ended, repaired, sometimes to Mr. Foster's lodgings, sometimes to some other place not far distant, where we continued such enquiries, and our numbers increased.\nDr. John Wallis, Account of Some Passages of his Life, 1700\nFrom the passage, one may infer that the main interest of Wallis's group was\nOptions:\nA. undermining of the traditional worldview\nB. creating of a secular science to challenge the Church\nC. ascertaining the state of the New Philosophy in England and abroad\nD. the regulation of new knowledge so as not to undermine traditional values\nAnswer:", "options": ["undermining of the traditional worldview", "creating of a secular science to challenge the Church", "ascertaining the state of the New Philosophy in England and abroad", "the regulation of new knowledge so as not to undermine traditional values"], "probs": [[0.3003803789615631, 0.29603493213653564, 0.3104531168937683, 0.09313154220581055], [0.08946577459573746, 0.19879205524921417, 0.05871935933828354, 0.653022825717926], [0.13980500400066376, 0.7568696737289429, 0.04404166713356972, 0.05928369611501694], [0.1840316504240036, 0.7404678463935852, 0.03685946390032768, 0.038641028106212616], [0.08448747545480728, 0.1462225764989853, 0.10199300944805145, 0.6672968864440918], [0.32214173674583435, 0.2758934497833252, 0.29390352964401245, 0.1080612987279892], [0.08459798991680145, 0.14648284018039703, 0.6567049622535706, 0.11221421509981155], [0.03504164516925812, 0.13249988853931427, 0.04431900009512901, 0.7881394028663635], [0.07357887923717499, 0.7106764912605286, 0.09610545635223389, 0.119639091193676], [0.08688898384571075, 0.6641777753829956, 0.09120610356330872, 0.15772710740566254], [0.03770054131746292, 0.1076170951128006, 0.08239543437957764, 0.7722868919372559], [0.10570225119590759, 0.13823483884334564, 0.5730639696121216, 0.1829988956451416], [0.3683556914329529, 0.4733537435531616, 0.069297656416893, 0.08899291604757309], [0.42851245403289795, 0.4424355626106262, 0.05898767337203026, 0.07006427645683289], [0.32799115777015686, 0.2153361737728119, 0.2723912000656128, 0.18428145349025726], [0.4119129478931427, 0.30155590176582336, 0.11452580243349075, 0.17200540006160736], [0.42197880148887634, 0.28579241037368774, 0.15065446496009827, 0.14157439768314362], [0.45276737213134766, 0.31134217977523804, 0.10598662495613098, 0.12990382313728333], [0.0682188868522644, 0.16645343601703644, 0.10572756826877594, 0.6596001982688904], [0.1347765326499939, 0.26861485838890076, 0.3970523178577423, 0.19955632090568542], [0.04648244008421898, 0.16762448847293854, 0.06766706705093384, 0.7182260155677795], [0.12175105512142181, 0.22089822590351105, 0.42589008808135986, 0.2314605712890625], [0.1075182855129242, 0.4681435823440552, 0.23522605001926422, 0.18911203742027283], [0.08993864804506302, 0.6159036159515381, 0.11207438260316849, 0.18208341300487518]], "ideal": "C"}}

The genius of Napoleon is astounding. All branches of human knowledge seemed alike familiar to his gigantic mind. His conversations at St. Helena, scattered through the numerous and voluminous memorials of those who gleaned them, are replete with intensest interest. During the long agony of his imprisonment and his death, he conversed with perfect freedom upon the events of his marvelous career, and upon all those subjects or morals, politics, and religion, which most deeply concern the welfare of our race. There is no mind which will not be invigorated by familiarity with these profound thoughts, expressed with so much glow of feeling and energy of diction.\n\u2014John S. C.

The Emperor Franz Joseph may, however, rest assured that His Majesty will faithfully stand by Austria-Hungary, as is required by the obligations of his alliance and of his ancient friendship.\nTheobald von Bethmann-Hollweg (chancellor of Germany), telegram to the German ambassador at Vienna, July 6, 1914\nFrom the passage, one may infer that Bethmann-Hollweg's telegram is often referred to as Germany's \"blank check\" because\nOptions:\nA. it pledged Germany to join the Triple Alliance and support Austria-Hungary against the Triple Entente\nB. it was understood to give Austria an unlimited scope of response to the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, to Serbia, and Pan-Slavism within the Austro-Hungarian Empire\nC. it pledged Germany's unlimited support to Franz Joseph in his efforts to succeed the recently assassinated Franz Ferdinand\nD. it offered nothing in terms of real support to Franz Joseph and Austria-Hungary\nAnswer:", "options": ["it pledged Germany to join the Triple Alliance and support Austria-Hungary against the Triple Entente", "it was understood to give Austria an unlimited scope of response to the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, to Serbia, and Pan-Slavism within the Austro-Hungarian Empire", "it pledged Germany's unlimited support to Franz Joseph in his efforts to succeed the recently assassinated Franz Ferdinand", "it offered nothing in terms of real support to Franz Joseph and Austria-Hungary"], "probs": [[0.09898840636014938, 0.7433663606643677, 0.052203405648469925, 0.10544180124998093], [0.1124076321721077, 0.744945764541626, 0.0433775894343853, 0.09926906228065491], [0.14652197062969208, 0.20036999881267548, 0.45885661244392395, 0.1942513883113861], [0.09759347140789032, 0.22705215215682983, 0.1123790368437767, 0.5629753470420837], [0.12204088270664215, 0.14959873259067535, 0.5561416149139404, 0.17221876978874207], [0.09071090817451477, 0.18051518499851227, 0.14503225684165955, 0.5837417244911194], [0.4154781103134155, 0.31358522176742554, 0.08059550821781158, 0.19034114480018616], [0.4411699175834656, 0.28035858273506165, 0.0666579157114029, 0.21181361377239227], [0.40562954545021057, 0.27447229623794556, 0.10262243449687958, 0.2172757238149643], [0.3485889434814453, 0.228659525513649, 0.09994378685951233, 0.32280781865119934], [0.4336329400539398, 0.22145292162895203, 0.10148011893033981, 0.24343402683734894], [0.3332093358039856, 0.1649893969297409, 0.17849983274936676, 0.32330137491226196], [0.13356930017471313, 0.22734618186950684, 0.43840697407722473, 0.2006775587797165], [0.06508377194404602, 0.24577823281288147, 0.0797760859131813, 0.6093618869781494], [0.0680716335773468, 0.7918470501899719, 0.04984040930867195, 0.09024094045162201], [0.0534290187060833, 0.8105610013008118, 0.03294236958026886, 0.1030675545334816], [0.07821758836507797, 0.20622344315052032, 0.1270335465669632, 0.5885254144668579], [0.08382387459278107, 0.1319446563720703, 0.5733572840690613, 0.21087419986724854], [0.09939835965633392, 0.23123732209205627, 0.4974988102912903, 0.1718655824661255], [0.060975924134254456, 0.3298739790916443, 0.09749201685190201, 0.5116580724716187], [0.016486236825585365, 0.9291749000549316, 0.015989501029253006, 0.038349270820617676], [0.013872281648218632, 0.928464412689209, 0.016228115186095238, 0.04143514484167099], [0.07055042684078217, 0.21078497171401978, 0.10763326287269592, 0.6110313534736633], [0.08695100992918015, 0.1434411257505417, 0.5331015586853027, 0.23650632798671722]], "ideal": "B"}}
{"type": "result", "data": {"idx": 70, "prompt": "The following are multiple choice questions about high school european history. You should directly answer the question by choosing the correct option.\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nFirst we must remark that the cosmos is spherical in form, partly because this form being a perfect whole requiring no joints, is the most complete of all, partly because it makes the most capacious form, which is best suited to contain and preserve everything; or again because all the constituent parts of the universe, that is the sun, moon and the planets appear in this form; or because everything strives to attain this form, as appears in the case of drops of water and other fluid bodies if they attempt to define themselves. So no one will doubt that this form belongs to the heavenly bodies. \u2026\nThat the earth is also spherical is therefore beyond question, because it presses from all sides upon its center. Although by reason of the elevations of the mountains and the depressions of the valleys a perfect circle cannot be understood, yet this does not affect the general spherical nature of the earth. \u2026\nAs it has been already shown that the earth has the form of a sphere, we must consider whether a movement also coincides with this form, and what place the earth holds in the universe. \u2026 The great majority of authors of course agree that the earth stands still in the center of the universe, and consider it inconceivable and ridiculous to suppose the opposite. But if the matter is carefully weighed, it will be seen that the question is not yet settled and therefore by no means to be regarded lightly. Every change of place which is observed is due, namely, to a movement of the observed object or of the observer, or to movements of both. \u2026 Now it is from the earth that the revolution of the heavens is observed and it is produced for our eyes. Therefore if the earth undergoes no movement this movement must take place in everything outside of the earth, but in the opposite direction than if everything on the earth moved, and of this kind is the daily revolution. So this appears to affect the whole universe, that is, everything outside the earth with the single exception of the earth itself.

{"type": "result", "data": {"idx": 72, "prompt": "The following are multiple choice questions about high school european history. You should directly answer the question by choosing the correct option.\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nFirst we must remark that the cosmos is spherical in form, partly because this form being a perfect whole requiring no joints, is the most complete of all, partly because it makes the most capacious form, which is best suited to contain and preserve everything; or again because all the constituent parts of the universe, that is the sun, moon and the planets appear in this form; or because everything strives to attain this form, as appears in the case of drops of water and other fluid bodies if they attempt to define themselves. So no one will doubt that this form belongs to the heavenly bodies. \u2026\nThat the earth is also spherical is therefore beyond question, because it presses from all sides upon its center. Although by reason of the elevations of the mountains and the depressions of the valleys a perfect circle cannot be understood, yet this does not affect the general spherical nature of the earth. \u2026\nAs it has been already shown that the earth has the form of a sphere, we must consider whether a movement also coincides with this form, and what place the earth holds in the universe. \u2026 The great majority of authors of course agree that the earth stands still in the center of the universe, and consider it inconceivable and ridiculous to suppose the opposite. But if the matter is carefully weighed, it will be seen that the question is not yet settled and therefore by no means to be regarded lightly. Every change of place which is observed is due, namely, to a movement of the observed object or of the observer, or to movements of both. \u2026 Now it is from the earth that the revolution of the heavens is observed and it is produced for our eyes. Therefore if the earth undergoes no movement this movement must take place in everything outside of the earth, but in the opposite direction than if everything on the earth moved, and of this kind is the daily revolution. So this appears to affect the whole universe, that is, everything outside the earth with the single exception of the earth itself. If, however, one should admit that this movement was not peculiar to the heavens, but that the earth revolved from west to east, and if this was carefully considered in regard to the apparent rising and setting of the sun, the moon and the stars, it would be discovered that this was the real situation.\"\nNicolas Copernicus, The Revolutions of the Heavenly Bodies, 1543\nFrom the passage, one could argue that Copernicus was working in\nOptions:\nA. the Aristotelian tradition\nB. the natural magic tradition\nC. the skeptical tradition\nD. the Platonic/Pythagorean tradition\nAnswer:", "options": ["the Aristotelian tradition", "the natural magic tradition", "the skeptical tradition", "the Platonic/Pythagorean tradition"], "probs": [[0.12224443256855011, 0.18952061235904694, 0.16470663249492645, 0.5235282778739929], [0.15615983307361603, 0.1855953186750412, 0.4893285930156708, 0.16891634464263916], [0.11899770051240921, 0.19636525213718414, 0.15060879290103912, 0.5340282917022705], [0.15906548500061035, 0.192025288939476, 0.5062707662582397, 0.1426384598016739], [0.2103189378976822, 0.57208651304245, 0.09196726232767105, 0.1256272941827774], [0.21043403446674347, 0.618901252746582, 0.07870914041996002, 0.09195554256439209], [0.09204518049955368, 0.25049322843551636, 0.15925632417201996, 0.4982052743434906], [0.13017527759075165, 0.20500725507736206, 0.5077376365661621, 0.1570797860622406], [0.09407033026218414, 0.16272278130054474, 0.2260056883096695, 0.5172011852264404], [0.10192736238241196, 0.14614729583263397, 0.5185031890869141, 0.2334221750497818], [0.13808216154575348, 0.3757140040397644, 0.3115957975387573, 0.1746080219745636], [0.10868832468986511, 0.48001962900161743, 0.1292126625776291, 0.28207942843437195], [0.12132981419563293, 0.23411141335964203, 0.14882896840572357, 0.4957297444343567], [0.18511083722114563, 0.21661686897277832, 0.4243204593658447, 0.17395181953907013], [0.11439671367406845, 0.14935524761676788, 0.23874936997890472, 0.49749863147735596], [0.12540556490421295, 0.135716050863266, 0.48144927620887756, 0.2574290633201599], [0.18646003305912018, 0.4916742742061615, 0.1896158903837204, 0.13224993646144867], [0.15411201119422913, 0.497919499874115, 0.11286070942878723, 0.23510773479938507], [0.2644514739513397, 0.494351863861084, 0.09737388789653778, 0.14382269978523254], [0.31359803676605225, 0.5014017224311829, 0.08316922187805176, 0.10183107852935791], [0.26856377720832825, 0.21594978868961334, 0.3094993531703949, 0.20598706603050232], [0.2622576057910919, 0.25437629222869873, 0.15676119923591614, 0.3266049921512604], [0.344873309135437, 0.24091173708438873, 0.24870075285434723, 0.16551418602466583], [0.27914729714393616, 0.26654520630836487, 0.14271540939807892, 0.31159210205078125]], "ideal": "C"}}

If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: \"I do not know him\"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, \"He is a man I never see\"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.\nNo one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.\nHe loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him.

Yet we may be allowed to doubt whether the union was not a little too speedy and a little too thorough. It is surely carrying unity too far to wipe out all traces of the independent being, for most purposes to wipe out the very name, of such a land as Sicily. It jars on our feelings to find that, while Ireland at least forms part of the royal style of its sovereign, Sicily is no longer even a geographical expression. The island realm of Roger has sunk to be seven provinces of the kingdom on the mainland. And there is another result of Italian unity, a result in which we may rejoice without drawbacks, but which still has somewhat of sadness about it as finally ending that great phase of the history of Europe with which we have throughout been dealing. Never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Italy entered liberated Rome. Of all novelties in European history the greatest was when Rome became the centre of a dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds, the head in short of a local Italian kingdom. \"Rome the capital of Italy\" was a formula which might well gladden our hearts; but it was a formula which formally swept away the \u0153cumenical position, the \u0153cumenical traditions, of Rome&\u2026.\nBut the kingdom of Italy is not an appendage to Rome; Rome is the head of the kingdom. The whole is greater than its part; Rome, by her own free will and by the free will of Italy, has become less than Italy. By becoming the willing head of an Italian kingdom she has formally cast aside her Imperial traditions as they were not cast aside when brute force made her the head of a French department.\"\nEdward A.

If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: \"I do not know him\"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, \"He is a man I never see\"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.\nNo one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.\nHe loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him. Motives of policy had something to do with this; by making expensive habits the fashion, and, for people in a certain position, a necessity, he compelled his courtiers to live beyond their income, and gradually reduced them to depend on his bounty for the means of subsistence.\n\u2014Duke Saint-Simon, Memoirs of Louis XIV and His Court and His Regency, c. 1750\nWhich of the following was the greatest weakness and regret of the rule of King Louis XIV?\nOptions:\nA.

By 1920 that fear was beginning to recede and Addison's policy was being regarded as extravagant. An immediate victim of the new attitude was the Borough's Kingfield Street scheme, provisional plans for which were approved in September 1920. Much to the Council's surprise, the Government's Housing Board deferred the scheme, \"having regard to the Council's present commitments and the money available at the present time, and in May 1921 the Government announced a drastic curtailment of the housing programme, cutting the housing target by half.\n\u2014Excerpt from a work by English historian Hermione Hobhouse Public Housing in Poplar: The Inter-war Years, 1994\nWhich of the following attitudes prevalent after the First World War is evident in the passage above?\nOptions:\nA.

Nor were there just three such stars; four wanderers complete their revolutions about Jupiter, and of their alterations as observed more precisely later on we shall give a description here. Also I measured the distances between them by means of the telescope. . . .\nSuch are the observations concerning the four Medicean planets recently first discovered by me, and although from this data their periods have not yet been reconstructed in numerical form, it is legitimate at least to put in evidence some facts worthy of note. Above all, since they sometimes follow and sometimes precede Jupiter by the same intervals, and they remain within very limited distances either to east or west of Jupiter, accompanying that planet in both its retrograde and direct movements in a constant manner, no one can doubt that they complete their revolutions about Jupiter and at the same time effect all together a twelve-year period about the center of the universe.\n\u2014Galileo Galilei, 1610\nWhich of the following is best demonstrated by the passage about intellectual thought at the time?\nOptions:\nA.

Of all of those acquirements, which more particularly belong to the feminine character, there are none which take a higher rank, in our estimation, than such as enter into a knowledge of household duties; for on these are perpetually dependent the happiness, comfort, and well-being of the family.\nIsabella Beeton, Book of Household Management, 1861\nFrom the passage, one may infer that Beeton believed that\nOptions:\nA. women held considerable power and responsibility in the public sphere of social life\nB. women were denied power and responsibility in the public sphere of social life\nC. women held considerable power and responsibility within the domestic sphere of social life\nD. women were denied power and responsibility within the domestic sphere of social life\nAnswer:", "options": ["women held considerable power and responsibility in the public sphere of social life", "women were denied power and responsibility in the public sphere of social life", "women held considerable power and responsibility within the domestic sphere of social life", "women were denied power and responsibility within the domestic sphere of social life"], "probs": [[0.021137138828635216, 0.010638175532221794, 0.957588791847229, 0.010635966435074806], [0.09642066061496735, 0.08390064537525177, 0.15917226672172546, 0.6605064272880554], [0.007879002019762993, 0.9853297472000122, 0.001932986662723124, 0.0048583014868199825], [0.009329724125564098, 0.9825189113616943, 0.002398617332801223, 0.005752814933657646], [0.12583495676517487, 0.15194404125213623, 0.050903040915727615, 0.6713180541992188], [0.07541554421186447, 0.03796903416514397, 0.8509445786476135, 0.03567073494195938], [0.0189284048974514, 0.025498995557427406, 0.9419275522232056, 0.013645014725625515], [0.09882001578807831, 0.22656995058059692, 0.15570522844791412, 0.5189047455787659], [0.005180929321795702, 0.9878858327865601, 0.0019079064950346947, 0.0050252266228199005], [0.005100942216813564, 0.9879213571548462, 0.0017924195853993297, 0.0051852199248969555], [0.010977093130350113, 0.9737047553062439, 0.002269184682518244, 0.013048899360001087], [0.014260631054639816, 0.9549798965454102, 0.009662507101893425, 0.021096834912896156], [0.8970303535461426, 0.06009228527545929, 0.007532662712037563, 0.035344794392585754], [0.93773353099823, 0.043177273124456406, 0.005497222300618887, 0.013591935858130455], [0.837428092956543, 0.08035891503095627, 0.012347057461738586, 0.06986595690250397], [0.8025330305099487, 0.09003780782222748, 0.015917975455522537, 0.09151116013526917], [0.9195420742034912, 0.05106799304485321, 0.008092856034636497, 0.021297119557857513], [0.8946115374565125, 0.058090608566999435, 0.010932181030511856, 0.03636568412184715], [0.09116756916046143, 0.18152031302452087, 0.05200209096074104, 0.6753100752830505], [0.038947321474552155, 0.03132406622171402, 0.9156082272529602, 0.01412032451480627], [0.14703552424907684, 0.1832539439201355, 0.08657687902450562, 0.5831336975097656], [0.05810333788394928, 0.047478336840867996, 0.8550601005554199, 0.03935819864273071], [0.017492685467004776, 0.9708172678947449, 0.004160258453339338, 0.00752980588003993], [0.014286014251410961, 0.9714670777320862, 0.0045722899958491325, 0.00967463944107294]], "ideal": "C"}}

And such an industrial basis cannot be created if our industry is not more highly developed technically. That is why a fast rate of development of our industry is necessary and imperative. We cannot go on indefinitely, that is, for too long a period, basing the Soviet regime and socialist construction on two different foundations, the foundation of the most large-scale and united socialist industry and the foundation of the most scattered and backward, small commodity economy of the peasants. We must gradually, but systematically and persistently, place our agriculture on a new technical basis, the basis of large-scale production, and bring it up to the level of socialist industry. Either we accomplish this task\u2014in which case the final victory of socialism in our country will be assured, or we turn away from it and do not accomplish it\u2014in which case a return to capitalism may become inevitable.\n\u2014Vladimir I.

You should directly answer the question by choosing the correct option.\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nThe following excerpt is from a speech by Vladimir I. Lenin.\nThe independence of our country cannot be upheld unless we have an adequate industrial basis for defense. And such an industrial basis cannot be created if our industry is not more highly developed technically. That is why a fast rate of development of our industry is necessary and imperative. We cannot go on indefinitely, that is, for too long a period, basing the Soviet regime and socialist construction on two different foundations, the foundation of the most large-scale and united socialist industry and the foundation of the most scattered and backward, small commodity economy of the peasants. We must gradually, but systematically and persistently, place our agriculture on a new technical basis, the basis of large-scale production, and bring it up to the level of socialist industry. Either we accomplish this task\u2014in which case the final victory of socialism in our country will be assured, or we turn away from it and do not accomplish it\u2014in which case a return to capitalism may become inevitable.\n\u2014Vladimir I.

His exile in Switzerland and other places led him to see how the industrialization of the West was needed in the Soviet Union.\nB.

The cord was wet and did not slip properly, and besides it was badly tied; in short, I still drew my breath, when the crucial incision made me give such a frightful scream that my surgeon fell flat upon his back&\u2026[At length he] sewed up my wounds; his wife even nursed me.

I was so long in delivering it that the Iman began to get angry, and seeing that I was a Christian he called out for help. They carried me before the cadi, who ordered me a hundred lashes on the soles of the feet and sent me to the galleys. I was chained to the very same galley and the same bench as the young Baron. On board this galley there were four young men from Marseilles, five Neapolitan priests, and two monks from Corfu, who told us similar adventures happened daily. The Baron maintained that he had suffered greater injustice than I&\u2026.We were continually disputing, and received twenty lashes with a bull's pizzle when the concatenation of universal events brought you to our galley, and you were good enough to ransom us.\"\n\"Well, my dear Pangloss,\" said Candide to him, \"when you had been hanged, dissected, whipped, and were tugging at the oar, did you always think that everything happens for the best?\"\n\"I am still of my first opinion,\" answered Pangloss, \"for I am a philosopher and I cannot retract, especially as Leibnitz could never be wrong; and besides, the pre-established harmony is the finest thing in the world, and so is his plenum and materia subtilis.\"\nVoltaire, French Enlightenment writer, Candide, 1759\nThe critiques offered by Voltaire through Candide are most closely shared by what other philosopher?\nOptions:\nA.

In ascribing the salvation of the remnant of the people to the election of grace, Paul clearly testifies, that it is then only known that God saves whom upon which there can be no claim. They who shut the gates to prevent anyone from presuming to approach and taste this doctrine, do no less injury to man than to God; for nothing else will be sufficient to produce in us suitable humility, or to impress us with a due sense of our great obligations to God. Nor is there any other basis for solid confidence, even according to the authority of Christ, who, to deliver us from all fear, and render us invincible amidst so many dangers, snares, and deadly conflicts, promises to preserve in safety all whom the Father has committed to His care.\n\u2014John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, 1559\nWhich of the following religions that started around the same time as Calvinism was destroyed for supporting adult baptism and pacifism?\nOptions:\nA.

{"type": "result", "data": {"idx": 106, "prompt": "The following are multiple choice questions about high school european history. You should directly answer the question by choosing the correct option.\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\n\"In 1500 that work appeared which Erasmus had written after his misfortune at Dover, and had dedicated to Mountjoy, the Adagiorum Collectanea. It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.\nUntil this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.\nErasmus made current the classic spirit.

You should directly answer the question by choosing the correct option.\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\n\"In 1500 that work appeared which Erasmus had written after his misfortune at Dover, and had dedicated to Mountjoy, the Adagiorum Collectanea. It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.\nUntil this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.\nErasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all.\"\nJohan Huizinga, twentieth-century Dutch philosopher, Erasmus and the Age of Reformation, 1924\nHuizinga's apparent support of Erasmus' belief in the \"book of antiquity\" being \"open to all\" is most likely a product of\nOptions:\nA. the author's life as a member of twentieth-century Europe, which prized such characteristics\nB. the longevity of Erasmus' works\nC. the Dutch reverence for the works of Erasmus\nD. the typical unflinching support of one philosopher for another philosopher's work\nAnswer:", "options": ["the author's life as a member of twentieth-century Europe, which prized such characteristics", "the longevity of Erasmus' works", "the Dutch reverence for the works of Erasmus", "the typical unflinching support of one philosopher for another philosopher's work"], "probs": [[0.287434458732605, 0.25373217463493347, 0.13805809617042542, 0.32077524065971375], [0.23993538320064545, 0.2476433366537094, 0.13473649322986603, 0.3776848614215851], [0.2903424799442291, 0.2949840724468231, 0.11030806601047516, 0.3043653666973114], [0.3135230839252472, 0.3235301077365875, 0.13711120188236237, 0.2258356362581253], [0.23667749762535095, 0.2682645916938782, 0.15056362748146057, 0.34449416399002075], [0.3126319348812103, 0.28028634190559387, 0.20203353464603424, 0.20504812896251678], [0.21542105078697205, 0.4285597503185272, 0.11183653026819229, 0.24418257176876068], [0.21590669453144073, 0.36740198731422424, 0.11208943277597427, 0.3046018183231354], [0.2223382145166397, 0.3039984107017517, 0.2331896424293518, 0.2404736429452896], [0.18478821218013763, 0.2863435745239258, 0.1374099850654602, 0.39145827293395996], [0.23084968328475952, 0.32060301303863525, 0.2103150337934494, 0.23823222517967224], [0.2002042829990387, 0.32005029916763306, 0.1442846655845642, 0.33546072244644165], [0.2959812879562378, 0.36844292283058167, 0.09768002480268478, 0.23789577186107635], [0.3302384316921234, 0.3684711456298828, 0.11602188646793365, 0.1852685958147049], [0.2843868136405945, 0.24331320822238922, 0.225151926279068, 0.24714799225330353], [0.2345552146434784, 0.2421046644449234, 0.14236138761043549, 0.3809787929058075], [0.32238325476646423, 0.3326836824417114, 0.1926375925540924, 0.15229547023773193], [0.22873014211654663, 0.31767526268959045, 0.12060872465372086, 0.33298587799072266], [0.28031864762306213, 0.3031383156776428, 0.11333734542131424, 0.3032057285308838], [0.37294378876686096, 0.3190000355243683, 0.1372969150543213, 0.17075923085212708], [0.29417967796325684, 0.2851691246032715, 0.15273600816726685, 0.2679152190685272], [0.25881603360176086, 0.262954443693161, 0.12427278608083725, 0.3539567291736603], [0.3575422763824463, 0.34117579460144043, 0.14012081921100616, 0.16116108000278473], [0.26403021812438965, 0.2900323271751404, 0.10675498843193054, 0.33918243646621704]], "ideal": "A"}}

The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.\n\u2014Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542\nThe free flow of plants and animals, as well as trade goods, between Europe and the Americas is referred to by historians as the Columbian Exchange, and affected the natives in which of the following ways?\nOptions:\nA.

And such an industrial basis cannot be created if our industry is not more highly developed technically. That is why a fast rate of development of our industry is necessary and imperative. We cannot go on indefinitely, that is, for too long a period, basing the Soviet regime and socialist construction on two different foundations, the foundation of the most large-scale and united socialist industry and the foundation of the most scattered and backward, small commodity economy of the peasants. We must gradually, but systematically and persistently, place our agriculture on a new technical basis, the basis of large-scale production, and bring it up to the level of socialist industry.

One would find it hard to imagine how the laws of movement cause such frightful disasters in the best of possible worlds. A hundred thousand ants, our fellows, crushed all at once in our ant-hill, and half of them perishing, no doubt in unspeakable agony, beneath the wreckage from which they cannot be drawn. Families ruined all over Europe, the fortune of a hundred businessmen, your compatriots, swallowed up in the ruins of Lisbon. What a wretched gamble is the game of human life! What will the preachers say, especially if the palace of the Inquisition is still standing? I flatter myself that at least the reverend father inquisitors have been crushed like others.

You should directly answer the question by choosing the correct option.\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nRead the following governmental report.\nOf the 450 sick persons whom the inhabitants were unable to relieve, 200 were turned out, and these we saw die one by one as they lay on the roadside. A large number still remain, and to each of them it is only possible to dole out the least scrap of bread. We only give bread to those who would otherwise die. The staple dish here consists of mice, which the inhabitants hunt, so desperate are they from hunger. They devour roots which the animals cannot eat; one can, in fact, not put into words the things one sees. . . . This narrative, far from exaggerating, rather understates the horror of the case, for it does not record the hundredth part of the misery in this district. Those who have not witnessed it with their own eyes cannot imagine how great it is. Not a day passes but at least 200 people die of famine in the two provinces. We certify to having ourselves seen herds, not of cattle, but of men and women, wandering about the fields between Rheims and Rh\u00e9tel, turning up the earth like pigs to find a few roots; and as they can only find rotten ones, and not half enough of them, they become so weak that they have not strength left to seek food. The parish priest at Boult, whose letter we enclose, tells us he has buried three of his parishioners who died of hunger. The rest subsisted on chopped straw mixed with earth, of which they composed a food which cannot be called bread.

And such an industrial basis cannot be created if our industry is not more highly developed technically. That is why a fast rate of development of our industry is necessary and imperative. We cannot go on indefinitely, that is, for too long a period, basing the Soviet regime and socialist construction on two different foundations, the foundation of the most large-scale and united socialist industry and the foundation of the most scattered and backward, small commodity economy of the peasants. We must gradually, but systematically and persistently, place our agriculture on a new technical basis, the basis of large-scale production, and bring it up to the level of socialist industry. Either we accomplish this task\u2014in which case the final victory of socialism in our country will be assured, or we turn away from it and do not accomplish it\u2014in which case a return to capitalism may become inevitable.\n\u2014Vladimir I.

It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones. Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinctive feature: it has simplified the class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes, directly facing each other: Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.\nKarl Marx and Friedrich Engels, The Communist Manifesto, 1848\nMarx and Engels would be most inclined to view which of the following developments as a significant event in European history?\nOptions:\nA.

His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you.

In ascribing the salvation of the remnant of the people to the election of grace, Paul clearly testifies, that it is then only known that God saves whom upon which there can be no claim. They who shut the gates to prevent anyone from presuming to approach and taste this doctrine, do no less injury to man than to God; for nothing else will be sufficient to produce in us suitable humility, or to impress us with a due sense of our great obligations to God.

Nor were there just three such stars; four wanderers complete their revolutions about Jupiter, and of their alterations as observed more precisely later on we shall give a description here. Also I measured the distances between them by means of the telescope. . . .\nSuch are the observations concerning the four Medicean planets recently first discovered by me, and although from this data their periods have not yet been reconstructed in numerical form, it is legitimate at least to put in evidence some facts worthy of note. Above all, since they sometimes follow and sometimes precede Jupiter by the same intervals, and they remain within very limited distances either to east or west of Jupiter, accompanying that planet in both its retrograde and direct movements in a constant manner, no one can doubt that they complete their revolutions about Jupiter and at the same time effect all together a twelve-year period about the center of the universe.\n\u2014Galileo Galilei, 1610\nWhich of the following intellectual hallmarks of the Renaissance seem most in conflict with the questioning of the ancient philosophers, such as Aristotle, through experimentation in natural philosophy?\nOptions:\nA.

Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.\n\u2014Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493\nSource 2\nIt was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive.

You should directly answer the question by choosing the correct option.\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\n\"The Italian nation has been at last united in our own days, and we all rejoiced in its union. Yet we may be allowed to doubt whether the union was not a little too speedy and a little too thorough. It is surely carrying unity too far to wipe out all traces of the independent being, for most purposes to wipe out the very name, of such a land as Sicily. It jars on our feelings to find that, while Ireland at least forms part of the royal style of its sovereign, Sicily is no longer even a geographical expression. The island realm of Roger has sunk to be seven provinces of the kingdom on the mainland. And there is another result of Italian unity, a result in which we may rejoice without drawbacks, but which still has somewhat of sadness about it as finally ending that great phase of the history of Europe with which we have throughout been dealing. Never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Italy entered liberated Rome. Of all novelties in European history the greatest was when Rome became the centre of a dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds, the head in short of a local Italian kingdom. \"Rome the capital of Italy\" was a formula which might well gladden our hearts; but it was a formula which formally swept away the \u0153cumenical position, the \u0153cumenical traditions, of Rome&\u2026.\nBut the kingdom of Italy is not an appendage to Rome; Rome is the head of the kingdom. The whole is greater than its part; Rome, by her own free will and by the free will of Italy, has become less than Italy.

As the present sciences are useless for the discovery of effects, so the present system of logic is useless for the discovery of the sciences.\nXIX. There are and can exist but two ways of investigating and discovering truth. The one hurries on rapidly from the senses and particulars to the most general axioms, and from them, as principles and their supposed indisputable truth, derives and discovers the intermediate axioms. This is the way now in use. The other constructs its axioms from the senses and particulars, by ascending continually and gradually, till it finally arrives at the most general axioms, which is the true but unattempted way.\nXXII. Each of these two ways begins from the senses and particulars, and ends in the greatest generalities&\u2026\nXXXVI.

You should directly answer the question by choosing the correct option.\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\n\"The Italian nation has been at last united in our own days, and we all rejoiced in its union. Yet we may be allowed to doubt whether the union was not a little too speedy and a little too thorough. It is surely carrying unity too far to wipe out all traces of the independent being, for most purposes to wipe out the very name, of such a land as Sicily. It jars on our feelings to find that, while Ireland at least forms part of the royal style of its sovereign, Sicily is no longer even a geographical expression. The island realm of Roger has sunk to be seven provinces of the kingdom on the mainland. And there is another result of Italian unity, a result in which we may rejoice without drawbacks, but which still has somewhat of sadness about it as finally ending that great phase of the history of Europe with which we have throughout been dealing. Never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Italy entered liberated Rome. Of all novelties in European history the greatest was when Rome became the centre of a dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds, the head in short of a local Italian kingdom. \"Rome the capital of Italy\" was a formula which might well gladden our hearts; but it was a formula which formally swept away the \u0153cumenical position, the \u0153cumenical traditions, of Rome&\u2026.\nBut the kingdom of Italy is not an appendage to Rome; Rome is the head of the kingdom. The whole is greater than its part; Rome, by her own free will and by the free will of Italy, has become less than Italy. By becoming the willing head of an Italian kingdom she has formally cast aside her Imperial traditions as they were not cast aside when brute force made her the head of a French department.\"\nEdward A.

The genius of Napoleon is astounding. All branches of human knowledge seemed alike familiar to his gigantic mind.

During the long agony of his imprisonment and his death, he conversed with perfect freedom upon the events of his marvelous career, and upon all those subjects or morals, politics, and religion, which most deeply concern the welfare of our race. There is no mind which will not be invigorated by familiarity with these profound thoughts, expressed with so much glow of feeling and energy of diction.\n\u2014John S. C.

If I remain longer doing nothing, I am lost. In this great Babylon one reputation quickly succeeds another. After I have been seen three times at the theatre, I shall not be looked at again. I shall therefore not go very frequently. (diary, 1798)\nIf the press is not bridled, I shall not remain three days in power. (diary, 1799)\nThe presence of a general is necessary; he is the head, he is the all in all of an army. It was not the Roman army that conquered Gaul, it was Caesar, it was not the Carthaginians that made the armies of the Roman republic tremble at the very gates of Rome, it was Hannibal.

Conquest has made me what I am; only conquest can maintain me. (diary, 1802)\nThe revolution in France is over and now there is only one party in France and I shall never allow the newspapers to say anything contrary to my interests. They may publish a few little articles with just a bit of poison in them, but one fine day I shall shut their mouths forever.

Nor were there just three such stars; four wanderers complete their revolutions about Jupiter, and of their alterations as observed more precisely later on we shall give a description here. Also I measured the distances between them by means of the telescope. . . .\nSuch are the observations concerning the four Medicean planets recently first discovered by me, and although from this data their periods have not yet been reconstructed in numerical form, it is legitimate at least to put in evidence some facts worthy of note. Above all, since they sometimes follow and sometimes precede Jupiter by the same intervals, and they remain within very limited distances either to east or west of Jupiter, accompanying that planet in both its retrograde and direct movements in a constant manner, no one can doubt that they complete their revolutions about Jupiter and at the same time effect all together a twelve-year period about the center of the universe.\n\u2014Galileo Galilei, 1610\nWhich of the following conclusions drawn in part from the observations above was the most revolutionary over time?\nOptions:\nA.
