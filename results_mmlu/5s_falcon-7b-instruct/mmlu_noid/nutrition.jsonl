Which one statement is correct (according to knowledge in 2020)?\nOptions:\nThe tea drinkers have lower risk of developing diabetes.\nThe tea drinkers have higher risk of developing diabetes.\nBased on the information given we cannot tell if the observed difference in disease risk is the result of chance.\nThe risk ratio is close to the value one, so there is no difference in disease risk between the two groups.\nAnswer: Based on the information given we cannot tell if the observed difference in disease risk is the result of chance.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is correct (according to knowledge in 2020)?\nOptions:\nConsumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener aspartame\nConsumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener saccharin\nConsumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener sucralose\nConsumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener acesulfame K\nAnswer: Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener aspartame\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is the most plausible explanation for the protective effect of dietary fibre against cancer of the colon, as of 2020?\nOptions:\nPropionic acid, formed during colonic fibre fermentation inhibits liver fatty acid synthesis\nButyric acid, formed during colonic fibre fermentation stimulates \"silencing\" of the SLC5A8 tumour suppressor gene\nNone of these options are correct\nButyric acid, formed during colonic fibre fermentation stimulates anti-oxidant defences in the colon\nAnswer: Butyric acid, formed during colonic fibre fermentation stimulates anti-oxidant defences in the colon\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about iodine is correct, as of 2020?\nOptions:\n50% of adults consume iodine at levels below the RNI\nDairy products are a poor source of iodine\nThe iodine content of organic milk is generally lower that the level in non-organic milk\nUK dietary reference values recommend an increase in iodine intake in pregnancy\nAnswer: The iodine content of organic milk is generally lower that the level in non-organic milk\n\nQuestion: What is the first-line drug for patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity, as of 2020?\nOptions:\nAcarbose\nMetformin\nSulphonylureas\nInsulin\nAnswer: Metformin\n\nQuestion: Which statement about the oral phase of digestion is INCORRECT?\nOptions:\nAbout 2% of the energy content of food is expended during the action of chewing and swallowing it.\nSwallowing involves contraction and relaxation of at least 14 groups of muscles in about 10 seconds in healthy subjects\nThe biofilm covering tooth enamel contains several salivary and bacterial enzymes\nSalivary amylase digests the dextran film on tooth enamel formed from dietary sucrose\nAnswer:", "options": ["About 2% of the energy content of food is expended during the action of chewing and swallowing it.", "Swallowing involves contraction and relaxation of at least 14 groups of muscles in about 10 seconds in healthy subjects", "The biofilm covering tooth enamel contains several salivary and bacterial enzymes", "Salivary amylase digests the dextran film on tooth enamel formed from dietary sucrose"], "lengths": [22, 23, 14, 20], "losses": [0.04168701171875, 0.145751953125, 0.1160888671875, 0.1820068359375], "probs": [0.27037655108059894, 0.24365436389249878, 0.2509901676268796, 0.2349789173729851], "sampled": "A", "ideal": "D", "correct": false}}
