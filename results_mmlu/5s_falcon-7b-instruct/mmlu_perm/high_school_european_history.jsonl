It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

They brought about almost immediate hardships for the Dutch economy as their dominance of overseas trade quickly ended.\nC. They were rescinded during the restoration of the Stuarts as they sought normal diplomatic relations with the Dutch so not as to need Parliament's financial support for war.\nD.

One would find it hard to imagine how the laws of movement cause such frightful disasters in the best of possible worlds. A hundred thousand ants, our fellows, crushed all at once in our ant-hill, and half of them perishing, no doubt in unspeakable agony, beneath the wreckage from which they cannot be drawn. Families ruined all over Europe, the fortune of a hundred businessmen, your compatriots, swallowed up in the ruins of Lisbon. What a wretched gamble is the game of human life! What will the preachers say, especially if the palace of the Inquisition is still standing? I flatter myself that at least the reverend father inquisitors have been crushed like others. That ought to teach men not to persecute each other, for while a few holy scoundrels burn a few fanatics, the earth swallows up one and all.\n\u2014Voltaire, in a letter, 1755\nThe ideas expressed by Voltaire, above, best illustrate which of the following characteristics of Enlightenment intellectuals?\nOptions:\nA.

These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you.

If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: \"I do not know him\"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, \"He is a man I never see\"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.\nNo one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.\nHe loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him. Motives of policy had something to do with this; by making expensive habits the fashion, and, for people in a certain position, a necessity, he compelled his courtiers to live beyond their income, and gradually reduced them to depend on his bounty for the means of subsistence.\n\u2014Duke Saint-Simon, Memoirs of Louis XIV and His Court and His Regency, c. 1750\nWhich of the following is the best explanation of the bias found in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

You should directly answer the question by choosing the correct option.\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nThe following excerpt is from a pamphlet.\nYou will do me the justice to remember, that I have always strenuously supported the Right of every man to his own opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine. He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.\nThe most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.\nThe circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.\nI believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.\nI believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.\nI do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.\nAll national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.\nI do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine.\n\u2014Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason, 1794\u20131795\nWhich of the following Enlightenment philosophes designed a system of checks and balances for government to avoid abuses of power?\nOptions:\nA.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte.

Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you.

Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.\n\u2014Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493\nSource 2\nIt was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.\n\u2014Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542\nWhich of the following would best account for the differences between the interactions of the Spaniards and the natives as described in the two accounts?\nOptions:\nA.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

The conquest of Europe by Napoleon led to the creation of new factions and shifted the European balance of power.\nC. The power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur.\nD. The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.\nThe circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.\nI believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.\nI believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.\nI do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of.

Adam Smith\nAnswer: B\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nRead the following excerpt.\nThe revolutionary seed had penetrated into every country and spread more or less. It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

The conquest of Europe by Napoleon led to the creation of new factions and shifted the European balance of power.\nC. The power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur.\nD. The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

So no one will doubt that this form belongs to the heavenly bodies. \u2026\nThat the earth is also spherical is therefore beyond question, because it presses from all sides upon its center. Although by reason of the elevations of the mountains and the depressions of the valleys a perfect circle cannot be understood, yet this does not affect the general spherical nature of the earth. \u2026\nAs it has been already shown that the earth has the form of a sphere, we must consider whether a movement also coincides with this form, and what place the earth holds in the universe. \u2026 The great majority of authors of course agree that the earth stands still in the center of the universe, and consider it inconceivable and ridiculous to suppose the opposite. But if the matter is carefully weighed, it will be seen that the question is not yet settled and therefore by no means to be regarded lightly. Every change of place which is observed is due, namely, to a movement of the observed object or of the observer, or to movements of both. \u2026 Now it is from the earth that the revolution of the heavens is observed and it is produced for our eyes. Therefore if the earth undergoes no movement this movement must take place in everything outside of the earth, but in the opposite direction than if everything on the earth moved, and of this kind is the daily revolution. So this appears to affect the whole universe, that is, everything outside the earth with the single exception of the earth itself. If, however, one should admit that this movement was not peculiar to the heavens, but that the earth revolved from west to east, and if this was carefully considered in regard to the apparent rising and setting of the sun, the moon and the stars, it would be discovered that this was the real situation.\"\nNicolas Copernicus, The Revolutions of the Heavenly Bodies, 1543\nFrom the passage, one may say that Copernicus's argument for a spherical cosmos was based on\nOptions:\nA. observation and induction\nB. ancient textual authority\nC. experimentation\nD. deduction from first principles\nAnswer:", "options": ["observation and induction", "ancient textual authority", "experimentation", "deduction from first principles"], "probs": [[0.3787965774536133, 0.30889177322387695, 0.16537189483642578, 0.1470775604248047], [0.3887956142425537, 0.32451391220092773, 0.1850264072418213, 0.10184156894683838], [0.3810305595397949, 0.30233001708984375, 0.18155527114868164, 0.13512253761291504], [0.37125396728515625, 0.31676197052001953, 0.19695091247558594, 0.11487829685211182], [0.380770206451416, 0.33432579040527344, 0.17856907844543457, 0.10638046264648438], [0.3690681457519531, 0.3328971862792969, 0.17371559143066406, 0.12435626983642578], [0.3475353717803955, 0.329465389251709, 0.15975713729858398, 0.16335153579711914], [0.3533766269683838, 0.3463020324707031, 0.18259167671203613, 0.11780619621276855], [0.34679150581359863, 0.31527042388916016, 0.17186212539672852, 0.16604018211364746], [0.34899258613586426, 0.3223729133605957, 0.17760252952575684, 0.15112924575805664], [0.3462953567504883, 0.34484195709228516, 0.18443036079406738, 0.12447714805603027], [0.3358154296875, 0.3307180404663086, 0.1680912971496582, 0.1653275489807129], [0.35734987258911133, 0.31142616271972656, 0.16798877716064453, 0.16314053535461426], [0.3465902805328369, 0.3263387680053711, 0.1880345344543457, 0.1390388011932373], [0.35387301445007324, 0.3061985969543457, 0.16669249534606934, 0.17323923110961914], [0.3563230037689209, 0.31207704544067383, 0.17402386665344238, 0.15759634971618652], [0.34438538551330566, 0.3290219306945801, 0.17199945449829102, 0.15456891059875488], [0.35514259338378906, 0.3182682991027832, 0.16209053993225098, 0.16448521614074707], [0.38982462882995605, 0.3081827163696289, 0.18408918380737305, 0.11794090270996094], [0.37836265563964844, 0.3025960922241211, 0.17972564697265625, 0.13940215110778809], [0.38490891456604004, 0.30350208282470703, 0.1911616325378418, 0.12043404579162598], [0.37172865867614746, 0.2910594940185547, 0.17811012268066406, 0.15919089317321777], [0.3754239082336426, 0.2974543571472168, 0.1851043701171875, 0.14184784889221191], [0.3834826946258545, 0.2893805503845215, 0.17604494094848633, 0.15090036392211914]], "ideal": "A"}}

They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything!

You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you.

Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.\n\u2014Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493\nSource 2\nIt was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.\n\u2014Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542\nWhich of the following motives for exploration is de las Casas most likely to think is most important in Source 2?\nOptions:\nA.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.\nThe circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.\nI believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.\nI believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.\nI do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.\nAll national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.\nI do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine.\n\u2014Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason, 1794\u20131795\nWhich of the following Enlightenment philosophes designed a system of checks and balances for government to avoid abuses of power?\nOptions:\nA.

Adam Smith\nAnswer: B\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nRead the following excerpt.\nThe revolutionary seed had penetrated into every country and spread more or less. It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA. The ideas of personal liberty and nationalism conceived during the Enlightenment resulted in radical revolutions that could spread throughout Europe.\nB. The conquest of Europe by Napoleon led to the creation of new factions and shifted the European balance of power.\nC. The power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur.\nD. The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

Adam Smith\nAnswer: B\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nRead the following excerpt.\nThe revolutionary seed had penetrated into every country and spread more or less. It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

The conquest of Europe by Napoleon led to the creation of new factions and shifted the European balance of power.\nC. The power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur.\nD. The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

They brought about almost immediate hardships for the Dutch economy as their dominance of overseas trade quickly ended.\nC. They were rescinded during the restoration of the Stuarts as they sought normal diplomatic relations with the Dutch so not as to need Parliament's financial support for war.\nD.

These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

You should directly answer the question by choosing the correct option.\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nThe following excerpt is from a pamphlet.\nYou will do me the justice to remember, that I have always strenuously supported the Right of every man to his own opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine. He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.\nThe most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.\nThe circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.\nI believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.\nI believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.\nI do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.\nAll national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.\nI do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine.\n\u2014Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason, 1794\u20131795\nWhich of the following Enlightenment philosophes designed a system of checks and balances for government to avoid abuses of power?\nOptions:\nA.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

As the present sciences are useless for the discovery of effects, so the present system of logic is useless for the discovery of the sciences.\nXIX. There are and can exist but two ways of investigating and discovering truth. The one hurries on rapidly from the senses and particulars to the most general axioms, and from them, as principles and their supposed indisputable truth, derives and discovers the intermediate axioms. This is the way now in use. The other constructs its axioms from the senses and particulars, by ascending continually and gradually, till it finally arrives at the most general axioms, which is the true but unattempted way.\nXXII. Each of these two ways begins from the senses and particulars, and ends in the greatest generalities&\u2026\nXXXVI.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

If I remain longer doing nothing, I am lost. In this great Babylon one reputation quickly succeeds another. After I have been seen three times at the theatre, I shall not be looked at again. I shall therefore not go very frequently. (diary, 1798)\nIf the press is not bridled, I shall not remain three days in power.

(diary, 1801)\nMy power proceeds from my reputation, and my reputation from the victories I have won. My power would fall if I were not to support it with more glory and more victories. Conquest has made me what I am; only conquest can maintain me. (diary, 1802)\nThe revolution in France is over and now there is only one party in France and I shall never allow the newspapers to say anything contrary to my interests. They may publish a few little articles with just a bit of poison in them, but one fine day I shall shut their mouths forever. (diary, 1805)\nWhile Napoleon was often praised for implementing his Napoleonic Code and a meritocracy in the army, the domestic issue that he was most often criticized for was which of the following?\nOptions:\nA.

The power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur.\nD. The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery!

He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you.

A large number still remain, and to each of them it is only possible to dole out the least scrap of bread. We only give bread to those who would otherwise die. The staple dish here consists of mice, which the inhabitants hunt, so desperate are they from hunger. They devour roots which the animals cannot eat; one can, in fact, not put into words the things one sees. . . . This narrative, far from exaggerating, rather understates the horror of the case, for it does not record the hundredth part of the misery in this district. Those who have not witnessed it with their own eyes cannot imagine how great it is. Not a day passes but at least 200 people die of famine in the two provinces. We certify to having ourselves seen herds, not of cattle, but of men and women, wandering about the fields between Rheims and Rh\u00e9tel, turning up the earth like pigs to find a few roots; and as they can only find rotten ones, and not half enough of them, they become so weak that they have not strength left to seek food. The parish priest at Boult, whose letter we enclose, tells us he has buried three of his parishioners who died of hunger. The rest subsisted on chopped straw mixed with earth, of which they composed a food which cannot be called bread. Other persons in the same place lived on the bodies of animals which had died of disease, and which the cur\u00e9, otherwise unable to help his people, allowed them to roast at the presbytery fire.\n\u2014Report of the Estates of Normandy, 1651\nWhich of the following would be most responsible for ending the problems of hunger mentioned above?\nOptions:\nA.

His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA. Capitalist\nB. Scientific\nC. Communist\nD. Existentialist\nAnswer: C\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nThe excerpts below are from the Navigation Acts of 1651.\n[A]fter the first day of December, one thousand six hundred fifty and one, and from thence forwards, no goods or commodities whatsoever of the growth, production or manufacture of Asia, Africa or America, or of any part thereof; or of any islands belonging to them, or which are described or laid down in the usual maps or cards of those places, as well of the English plantations as others, shall be imported or brought into this Commonwealth of England, or into Ireland, or any other lands, islands, plantations, or territories to this Commonwealth belonging, or in their possession, in any other ship or ships, vessel or vessels whatsoever, but only in such as do truly and without fraud belong only to the people of this Commonwealth, or the plantations thereof, as the proprietors or right owners thereof; and whereof the master and mariners are also of the people of this Commonwealth, under the penalty of the forfeiture and loss of all the goods that shall be imported contrary to this act, , , ,\n[N]o goods or commodities of the growth, production, or manufacture of Europe, or of any part thereof, shall after the first day of December, one thousand six hundred fifty and one, be imported or brought into this Commonwealth of England, or any other lands or territories to this Commonwealth belonging, or in their possession, in any ship or ships, vessel or vessels whatsoever, but in such as do truly and without fraud belong only to the people of this Commonwealth, and in no other, except only such foreign ships and vessels as do truly and properly belong to the people of that country or place, of which the said goods are the growth, production or manufacture.\nWhich of the following best describes the outcome of the Navigation Acts of 1651?\nOptions:\nA. They served as a catalyst for the growth of English shipping and overseas trade, but did little to limit the prospects of the Dutch in the seventeenth century.\nB. They brought about almost immediate hardships for the Dutch economy as their dominance of overseas trade quickly ended.\nC. They were rescinded during the restoration of the Stuarts as they sought normal diplomatic relations with the Dutch so not as to need Parliament's financial support for war.\nD. They led to nearly a century of recurrent war between England and the Netherlands, which would not end until after American independence.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nAlbeit the king's Majesty justly and rightfully is and ought to be the supreme head of the Church of England, and so is recognized by the clergy of this realm in their convocations, yet nevertheless, for corroboration and confirmation thereof, and for increase of virtue in Christ's religion within this realm of England, and to repress and extirpate all errors, heresies, and other enormities and abuses heretofore used in the same, be it enacted, by authority of this present Parliament, that the king, our sovereign lord, his heirs and successors, kings of this realm, shall be taken, accepted, and reputed the only supreme head in earth of the Church of England, called Anglicans Ecclesia; and shall have and enjoy, annexed and united to the imperial crown of this realm, as well the title and style thereof, as all honors, dignities, preeminences, jurisdictions, privileges, authorities, immunities, profits, and commodities to the said dignity of the supreme head of the same Church belonging and appertaining; and that our said sovereign lord, his heirs and successors, kings of this realm, shall have full power and authority from time to time to visit, repress, redress, record, order, correct, restrain, and amend all such errors, heresies, abuses, offenses, contempts, and enormities, whatsoever they be, which by any manner of spiritual authority or jurisdiction ought or may lawfully be reformed, repressed, ordered, redressed, corrected, restrained, or amended, most to the pleasure of Almighty God, the increase of virtue in Christ's religion, and for the conservation of the peace, unity, and tranquility of this realm; any usage, foreign land, foreign authority, prescription, or any other thing or things to the contrary hereof notwithstanding.\nEnglish Parliament, Act of Supremacy, 1534\nFrom the passage, one may infer that the English Parliament wished to argue that the Act of Supremacy would\nOptions:\nA. give the English king a new position of authority\nB. give the position of head of the Church of England to Henry VIII alone and exclude his heirs\nC. establish Calvinism as the one true theology in England\nD. end various forms of corruption plaguing the Church in England\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\n\"But you, my dear Pangloss,\" said Candide, \"how can it be that I behold you again?\"\n\"It is true,\" said Pangloss, \"that you saw me hanged&\u2026.A surgeon purchased my body, carried home, and dissected me. He began with making a crucial incision on me from the navel to the clavicula. One could not have been worse hanged than I was. The executioner of the Holy Inquisition was a sub-deacon, and knew how to burn people marvellously well, but he was not accustomed to hanging. The cord was wet and did not slip properly, and besides it was badly tied; in short, I still drew my breath, when the crucial incision made me give such a frightful scream that my surgeon fell flat upon his back&\u2026[At length he] sewed up my wounds; his wife even nursed me. I was upon my legs at the end of fifteen days&\u2026.\nOne day I took it into my head to step into a mosque, where I saw an old Iman and a very pretty young devotee who was saying her paternosters&\u2026.She dropped her bouquet; I picked it up, and presented it to her with a profound reverence. I was so long in delivering it that the Iman began to get angry, and seeing that I was a Christian he called out for help. They carried me before the cadi, who ordered me a hundred lashes on the soles of the feet and sent me to the galleys. I was chained to the very same galley and the same bench as the young Baron. On board this galley there were four young men from Marseilles, five Neapolitan priests, and two monks from Corfu, who told us similar adventures happened daily. The Baron maintained that he had suffered greater injustice than I&\u2026.We were continually disputing, and received twenty lashes with a bull's pizzle when the concatenation of universal events brought you to our galley, and you were good enough to ransom us.\"\n\"Well, my dear Pangloss,\" said Candide to him, \"when you had been hanged, dissected, whipped, and were tugging at the oar, did you always think that everything happens for the best?\"\n\"I am still of my first opinion,\" answered Pangloss, \"for I am a philosopher and I cannot retract, especially as Leibnitz could never be wrong; and besides, the pre-established harmony is the finest thing in the world, and so is his plenum and materia subtilis.\"\nVoltaire, French Enlightenment writer, Candide, 1759\nThe themes of the passage and the mode in which Pangloss tells them show the influence of\nOptions:\nA.

We then discoursed of the circulation of the blood, the valves in the veins, the venae lactae, the lymphatic vessels, the Copernican hypothesis, the nature of comets and new stars, the satellites of Jupiter, the oval shape (as it then appeared) of Saturn, the spots in the sun, and its turning on its own axis, the inequalities and selenography of the moon, the several phases of Venus and Mercury, the improvement of telescopes, and grinding of glasses for that purpose, the weight of air, the possibility, or impossibility of vacuities, and nature's abhorrence thereof, the Torricellian experiment in quicksilver, the descent of heavy bodies, and the degrees of acceleration therein; and divers other things of like nature. Some of which were then but new discoveries, and others not so generally known and embraced, as now they are. \u2026\nWe barred all discourses of divinity, of state affairs, and of news, other than what concerned our business of Philosophy. These meetings we removed soon after to the Bull Head in Cheapside, and in term-time to Gresham College, where we met weekly at Mr. Foster's lecture (then Astronomy Professor there), and, after the lecture ended, repaired, sometimes to Mr. Foster's lodgings, sometimes to some other place not far distant, where we continued such enquiries, and our numbers increased.\nDr. John Wallis, Account of Some Passages of his Life, 1700\nThe passage may be used as evidence for the development of\nOptions:\nA. an independent society for the study of natural philosophy in the seventeenth century\nB. the study of natural philosophy in the royal courts in the seventeenth century\nC. new universities for the study of natural philosophy in the seventeenth century\nD. the study of natural philosophy in the Church in the seventeenth century\nAnswer:", "options": ["an independent society for the study of natural philosophy in the seventeenth century", "the study of natural philosophy in the royal courts in the seventeenth century", "new universities for the study of natural philosophy in the seventeenth century", "the study of natural philosophy in the Church in the seventeenth century"], "probs": [[0.3685793876647949, 0.29601287841796875, 0.178192138671875, 0.15729975700378418], [0.37345075607299805, 0.29867076873779297, 0.1806163787841797, 0.14724993705749512], [0.3668532371520996, 0.2942848205566406, 0.1880970001220703, 0.1508035659790039], [0.3688340187072754, 0.2960367202758789, 0.19070720672607422, 0.14445734024047852], [0.37932872772216797, 0.2991657257080078, 0.17449140548706055, 0.14688849449157715], [0.37937307357788086, 0.29825496673583984, 0.1726994514465332, 0.14972829818725586], [0.36346864700317383, 0.29143285751342773, 0.18890810012817383, 0.15623712539672852], [0.36638498306274414, 0.2955617904663086, 0.1902327537536621, 0.1479039192199707], [0.34660911560058594, 0.29463815689086914, 0.19591283798217773, 0.16285085678100586], [0.34393310546875, 0.2953767776489258, 0.1993722915649414, 0.16127729415893555], [0.36516284942626953, 0.29675722122192383, 0.1837167739868164, 0.154252290725708], [0.3564329147338867, 0.2912149429321289, 0.1866302490234375, 0.16568803787231445], [0.3670949935913086, 0.29674577713012695, 0.18590593338012695, 0.15032196044921875], [0.3695640563964844, 0.29752206802368164, 0.18876075744628906, 0.14422154426574707], [0.3607602119445801, 0.30142927169799805, 0.1816544532775879, 0.15633416175842285], [0.3563704490661621, 0.299468994140625, 0.1868152618408203, 0.15744519233703613], [0.373016357421875, 0.30146360397338867, 0.1757969856262207, 0.14961957931518555], [0.36346435546875, 0.298734188079834, 0.18044137954711914, 0.15720510482788086], [0.36637210845947266, 0.2952876091003418, 0.1919245719909668, 0.1465458869934082], [0.36837244033813477, 0.29193115234375, 0.19075632095336914, 0.14890146255493164], [0.3578033447265625, 0.29525232315063477, 0.1938648223876953, 0.15325522422790527], [0.34857892990112305, 0.2899508476257324, 0.19813060760498047, 0.1633439064025879], [0.35199928283691406, 0.2944064140319824, 0.1977682113647461, 0.15563249588012695], [0.3449063301086426, 0.2951169013977051, 0.200836181640625, 0.15931367874145508]], "ideal": "A"}}

It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.\nUntil this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.\nErasmus made current the classic spirit.

His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

I was so long in delivering it that the Iman began to get angry, and seeing that I was a Christian he called out for help. They carried me before the cadi, who ordered me a hundred lashes on the soles of the feet and sent me to the galleys. I was chained to the very same galley and the same bench as the young Baron.

Adam Smith\nAnswer: B\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nRead the following excerpt.\nThe revolutionary seed had penetrated into every country and spread more or less. It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA. The ideas of personal liberty and nationalism conceived during the Enlightenment resulted in radical revolutions that could spread throughout Europe.\nB. The conquest of Europe by Napoleon led to the creation of new factions and shifted the European balance of power.\nC. The power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur.\nD. The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA. Capitalist\nB. Scientific\nC. Communist\nD. Existentialist\nAnswer: C\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nThe excerpts below are from the Navigation Acts of 1651.\n[A]fter the first day of December, one thousand six hundred fifty and one, and from thence forwards, no goods or commodities whatsoever of the growth, production or manufacture of Asia, Africa or America, or of any part thereof; or of any islands belonging to them, or which are described or laid down in the usual maps or cards of those places, as well of the English plantations as others, shall be imported or brought into this Commonwealth of England, or into Ireland, or any other lands, islands, plantations, or territories to this Commonwealth belonging, or in their possession, in any other ship or ships, vessel or vessels whatsoever, but only in such as do truly and without fraud belong only to the people of this Commonwealth, or the plantations thereof, as the proprietors or right owners thereof; and whereof the master and mariners are also of the people of this Commonwealth, under the penalty of the forfeiture and loss of all the goods that shall be imported contrary to this act, , , ,\n[N]o goods or commodities of the growth, production, or manufacture of Europe, or of any part thereof, shall after the first day of December, one thousand six hundred fifty and one, be imported or brought into this Commonwealth of England, or any other lands or territories to this Commonwealth belonging, or in their possession, in any ship or ships, vessel or vessels whatsoever, but in such as do truly and without fraud belong only to the people of this Commonwealth, and in no other, except only such foreign ships and vessels as do truly and properly belong to the people of that country or place, of which the said goods are the growth, production or manufacture.\nWhich of the following best describes the outcome of the Navigation Acts of 1651?\nOptions:\nA. They served as a catalyst for the growth of English shipping and overseas trade, but did little to limit the prospects of the Dutch in the seventeenth century.\nB. They brought about almost immediate hardships for the Dutch economy as their dominance of overseas trade quickly ended.\nC. They were rescinded during the restoration of the Stuarts as they sought normal diplomatic relations with the Dutch so not as to need Parliament's financial support for war.\nD.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA. The ideas of personal liberty and nationalism conceived during the Enlightenment resulted in radical revolutions that could spread throughout Europe.\nB. The conquest of Europe by Napoleon led to the creation of new factions and shifted the European balance of power.\nC. The power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur.\nD. The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery!

He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you.

Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.\n\u2014Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493\nSource 2\nIt was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive.

His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

The genius of Napoleon is astounding. All branches of human knowledge seemed alike familiar to his gigantic mind. His conversations at St. Helena, scattered through the numerous and voluminous memorials of those who gleaned them, are replete with intensest interest. During the long agony of his imprisonment and his death, he conversed with perfect freedom upon the events of his marvelous career, and upon all those subjects or morals, politics, and religion, which most deeply concern the welfare of our race.

His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

They served as a catalyst for the growth of English shipping and overseas trade, but did little to limit the prospects of the Dutch in the seventeenth century.\nB. They brought about almost immediate hardships for the Dutch economy as their dominance of overseas trade quickly ended.\nC. They were rescinded during the restoration of the Stuarts as they sought normal diplomatic relations with the Dutch so not as to need Parliament's financial support for war.\nD. They led to nearly a century of recurrent war between England and the Netherlands, which would not end until after American independence.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nAlbeit the king's Majesty justly and rightfully is and ought to be the supreme head of the Church of England, and so is recognized by the clergy of this realm in their convocations, yet nevertheless, for corroboration and confirmation thereof, and for increase of virtue in Christ's religion within this realm of England, and to repress and extirpate all errors, heresies, and other enormities and abuses heretofore used in the same, be it enacted, by authority of this present Parliament, that the king, our sovereign lord, his heirs and successors, kings of this realm, shall be taken, accepted, and reputed the only supreme head in earth of the Church of England, called Anglicans Ecclesia; and shall have and enjoy, annexed and united to the imperial crown of this realm, as well the title and style thereof, as all honors, dignities, preeminences, jurisdictions, privileges, authorities, immunities, profits, and commodities to the said dignity of the supreme head of the same Church belonging and appertaining; and that our said sovereign lord, his heirs and successors, kings of this realm, shall have full power and authority from time to time to visit, repress, redress, record, order, correct, restrain, and amend all such errors, heresies, abuses, offenses, contempts, and enormities, whatsoever they be, which by any manner of spiritual authority or jurisdiction ought or may lawfully be reformed, repressed, ordered, redressed, corrected, restrained, or amended, most to the pleasure of Almighty God, the increase of virtue in Christ's religion, and for the conservation of the peace, unity, and tranquility of this realm; any usage, foreign land, foreign authority, prescription, or any other thing or things to the contrary hereof notwithstanding.\nEnglish Parliament, Act of Supremacy, 1534\nFrom the passage, one may infer that the English Parliament wished to argue that the Act of Supremacy would\nOptions:\nA. give the English king a new position of authority\nB. give the position of head of the Church of England to Henry VIII alone and exclude his heirs\nC. establish Calvinism as the one true theology in England\nD. end various forms of corruption plaguing the Church in England\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nRead the following quote.\nI had now decided beyond all question that there existed in the heavens three stars wandering about Jupiter as do Venus and Mercury about the sun, and this became plainer than daylight from observations on similar occasions which followed. Nor were there just three such stars; four wanderers complete their revolutions about Jupiter, and of their alterations as observed more precisely later on we shall give a description here. Also I measured the distances between them by means of the telescope. . . .\nSuch are the observations concerning the four Medicean planets recently first discovered by me, and although from this data their periods have not yet been reconstructed in numerical form, it is legitimate at least to put in evidence some facts worthy of note. Above all, since they sometimes follow and sometimes precede Jupiter by the same intervals, and they remain within very limited distances either to east or west of Jupiter, accompanying that planet in both its retrograde and direct movements in a constant manner, no one can doubt that they complete their revolutions about Jupiter and at the same time effect all together a twelve-year period about the center of the universe.\n\u2014Galileo Galilei, 1610\nWhich of the following Polish thinkers was most likely the person whose ideas convinced Galileo to have written the statement above?\nOptions:\nA.

You should directly answer the question by choosing the correct option.\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nThe following excerpt is from a pamphlet.\nYou will do me the justice to remember, that I have always strenuously supported the Right of every man to his own opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine. He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.\nThe most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.\nThe circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.\nI believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.\nI believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.\nI do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.\nAll national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.\nI do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine.\n\u2014Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason, 1794\u20131795\nWhich of the following Enlightenment philosophes designed a system of checks and balances for government to avoid abuses of power?\nOptions:\nA.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

You should directly answer the question by choosing the correct option.\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nThe following excerpt is from a pamphlet.\nYou will do me the justice to remember, that I have always strenuously supported the Right of every man to his own opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine. He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.\nThe most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.\nThe circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.\nI believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.\nI believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.\nI do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.\nAll national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.\nI do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine.\n\u2014Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason, 1794\u20131795\nWhich of the following Enlightenment philosophes designed a system of checks and balances for government to avoid abuses of power?\nOptions:\nA.

Adam Smith\nAnswer: B\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nRead the following excerpt.\nThe revolutionary seed had penetrated into every country and spread more or less. It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte.

I have instanced Louis the XVI, who loved the trade of locksmith; an Infanta of Spain preferred that of shoemaker; a certain king of Denmark gratified himself by manufacturing syringes; the former king of Naples loved to sell the fish he had caught in the market-place himself; the prince of Parma, whom Condillac had trained in metaphysical subtitles, in the understanding of intuition, of cognition, had no taste but for the occupation of church-warden and lay-brother.\nThe great majority of wealthy children would follow these plebeian tastes, if civilized education did not oppose the development of them; and if the filthiness of the workshops and the coarseness of the workmen did not arouse a repugnance stronger than the attraction. What child of a prince is there who has no taste for one of the four occupations I have just mentioned, that of mason, carpenter, smith, saddler, and who would not advance in them if he beheld from an early age the work carried on in blight workshops, by refined people, who would always arrange a miniature workshop for children, with little implements and light labor?\n\u2014Charles Fourier, On Education, 1838\nMany in Fourier's circles advocated for universal male suffrage, which was propagated most by which of the following groups?\nOptions:\nA.

His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA. The ideas of personal liberty and nationalism conceived during the Enlightenment resulted in radical revolutions that could spread throughout Europe.\nB. The conquest of Europe by Napoleon led to the creation of new factions and shifted the European balance of power.\nC. The power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur.\nD. The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

They brought about almost immediate hardships for the Dutch economy as their dominance of overseas trade quickly ended.\nC. They were rescinded during the restoration of the Stuarts as they sought normal diplomatic relations with the Dutch so not as to need Parliament's financial support for war.\nD.

The success of the revolution discredited conservative ideas; the failure of the revolution discredited liberal ideas. After it, nothing remained but the idea of Force, and this idea stood at the helm of German history from then on. For the first time since 1521, the German people stepped on to the centre of the German stage only to miss their cue once more. German history reached its turning-point and failed to turn.

The power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur.\nD. The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

By 1920 that fear was beginning to recede and Addison's policy was being regarded as extravagant. An immediate victim of the new attitude was the Borough's Kingfield Street scheme, provisional plans for which were approved in September 1920. Much to the Council's surprise, the Government's Housing Board deferred the scheme, \"having regard to the Council's present commitments and the money available at the present time, and in May 1921 the Government announced a drastic curtailment of the housing programme, cutting the housing target by half.\n\u2014Excerpt from a work by English historian Hermione Hobhouse Public Housing in Poplar: The Inter-war Years, 1994\nWhich of the following is the best description of the plans being changed above?\nOptions:\nA.

You should directly answer the question by choosing the correct option.\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nThe following excerpt is from a pamphlet.\nYou will do me the justice to remember, that I have always strenuously supported the Right of every man to his own opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine. He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.\nThe most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.\nThe circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.\nI believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.\nI believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.\nI do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.\nAll national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.\nI do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine.\n\u2014Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason, 1794\u20131795\nWhich of the following Enlightenment philosophes designed a system of checks and balances for government to avoid abuses of power?\nOptions:\nA.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

The success of the revolution discredited conservative ideas; the failure of the revolution discredited liberal ideas. After it, nothing remained but the idea of Force, and this idea stood at the helm of German history from then on. For the first time since 1521, the German people stepped on to the centre of the German stage only to miss their cue once more. German history reached its turning-point and failed to turn. This was the fateful essence of 1848.\nA. J. P. Taylor, The Course of German History, 1945\nWhy might it be important to note that Taylor was writing his analysis in 1945?\nOptions:\nA.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte.

His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

The conquest of Europe by Napoleon led to the creation of new factions and shifted the European balance of power.\nC. The power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur.\nD. The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

They brought about almost immediate hardships for the Dutch economy as their dominance of overseas trade quickly ended.\nC. They were rescinded during the restoration of the Stuarts as they sought normal diplomatic relations with the Dutch so not as to need Parliament's financial support for war.\nD.

He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering.

These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.\nUntil this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.\nErasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all.\"\nJohan Huizinga, twentieth-century Dutch philosopher, Erasmus and the Age of Reformation, 1924\nThe type of humanism attributed to Erasmus in this passage is most similar to what Southern Renaissance movement?\nOptions:\nA.

He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.\nThe most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.\nThe circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.\nI believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.\nI believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.\nI do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that?

You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you.

Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA. The ideas of personal liberty and nationalism conceived during the Enlightenment resulted in radical revolutions that could spread throughout Europe.\nB. The conquest of Europe by Napoleon led to the creation of new factions and shifted the European balance of power.\nC. The power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur.\nD. The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery!

These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA. The ideas of personal liberty and nationalism conceived during the Enlightenment resulted in radical revolutions that could spread throughout Europe.\nB. The conquest of Europe by Napoleon led to the creation of new factions and shifted the European balance of power.\nC. The power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur.\nD. The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

We then discoursed of the circulation of the blood, the valves in the veins, the venae lactae, the lymphatic vessels, the Copernican hypothesis, the nature of comets and new stars, the satellites of Jupiter, the oval shape (as it then appeared) of Saturn, the spots in the sun, and its turning on its own axis, the inequalities and selenography of the moon, the several phases of Venus and Mercury, the improvement of telescopes, and grinding of glasses for that purpose, the weight of air, the possibility, or impossibility of vacuities, and nature's abhorrence thereof, the Torricellian experiment in quicksilver, the descent of heavy bodies, and the degrees of acceleration therein; and divers other things of like nature. Some of which were then but new discoveries, and others not so generally known and embraced, as now they are. \u2026\nWe barred all discourses of divinity, of state affairs, and of news, other than what concerned our business of Philosophy. These meetings we removed soon after to the Bull Head in Cheapside, and in term-time to Gresham College, where we met weekly at Mr. Foster's lecture (then Astronomy Professor there), and, after the lecture ended, repaired, sometimes to Mr. Foster's lodgings, sometimes to some other place not far distant, where we continued such enquiries, and our numbers increased.\nDr. John Wallis, Account of Some Passages of his Life, 1700\nFrom the passage, one may infer that the main interest of Wallis's group was\nOptions:\nA. undermining of the traditional worldview\nB. creating of a secular science to challenge the Church\nC. ascertaining the state of the New Philosophy in England and abroad\nD. the regulation of new knowledge so as not to undermine traditional values\nAnswer:", "options": ["undermining of the traditional worldview", "creating of a secular science to challenge the Church", "ascertaining the state of the New Philosophy in England and abroad", "the regulation of new knowledge so as not to undermine traditional values"], "probs": [[0.3458127975463867, 0.27260875701904297, 0.18211936950683594, 0.19943666458129883], [0.3466665744781494, 0.2648172378540039, 0.1747884750366211, 0.2135148048400879], [0.3585524559020996, 0.2772841453552246, 0.17871761322021484, 0.1853642463684082], [0.36296606063842773, 0.27385997772216797, 0.18316936492919922, 0.18014907836914062], [0.35228776931762695, 0.2618579864501953, 0.17955541610717773, 0.20650839805603027], [0.3519172668457031, 0.26717233657836914, 0.1882314682006836, 0.19270563125610352], [0.3389296531677246, 0.2811465263366699, 0.17186355590820312, 0.2079610824584961], [0.3398127555847168, 0.27190589904785156, 0.15993690490722656, 0.2281794548034668], [0.34243059158325195, 0.28693389892578125, 0.1806182861328125, 0.1899552345275879], [0.3619832992553711, 0.3020763397216797, 0.1886606216430664, 0.14745759963989258], [0.343982458114624, 0.26848649978637695, 0.18201255798339844, 0.20555472373962402], [0.35802793502807617, 0.29659318923950195, 0.19605255126953125, 0.1493675708770752], [0.35505199432373047, 0.2862706184387207, 0.1600942611694336, 0.19889211654663086], [0.35727739334106445, 0.2953476905822754, 0.16051006317138672, 0.18696260452270508], [0.34648656845092773, 0.2870321273803711, 0.1759204864501953, 0.1904597282409668], [0.37563180923461914, 0.30617809295654297, 0.17890167236328125, 0.13946223258972168], [0.355130672454834, 0.2949075698852539, 0.17295551300048828, 0.1770639419555664], [0.37341880798339844, 0.30907487869262695, 0.18256235122680664, 0.13478803634643555], [0.3443179130554199, 0.27421045303344727, 0.15968799591064453, 0.2217569351196289], [0.34691953659057617, 0.2950258255004883, 0.17159557342529297, 0.1863241195678711], [0.3484048843383789, 0.2839341163635254, 0.16881036758422852, 0.19883990287780762], [0.372495174407959, 0.31697845458984375, 0.1801609992980957, 0.13029170036315918], [0.3517909049987793, 0.30922412872314453, 0.17551422119140625, 0.16341304779052734], [0.3669161796569824, 0.32610416412353516, 0.18439960479736328, 0.12283992767333984]], "ideal": "C"}}

You should directly answer the question by choosing the correct option.\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nThe following excerpt is from a pamphlet.\nYou will do me the justice to remember, that I have always strenuously supported the Right of every man to his own opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine. He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.\nThe most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.\nThe circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.\nI believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.\nI believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.\nI do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.\nAll national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.\nI do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine.\n\u2014Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason, 1794\u20131795\nWhich of the following Enlightenment philosophes designed a system of checks and balances for government to avoid abuses of power?\nOptions:\nA.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

Adam Smith\nAnswer: B\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nRead the following excerpt.\nThe revolutionary seed had penetrated into every country and spread more or less. It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

The power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur.\nD. The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

The genius of Napoleon is astounding. All branches of human knowledge seemed alike familiar to his gigantic mind. His conversations at St. Helena, scattered through the numerous and voluminous memorials of those who gleaned them, are replete with intensest interest. During the long agony of his imprisonment and his death, he conversed with perfect freedom upon the events of his marvelous career, and upon all those subjects or morals, politics, and religion, which most deeply concern the welfare of our race.

So no one will doubt that this form belongs to the heavenly bodies. \u2026\nThat the earth is also spherical is therefore beyond question, because it presses from all sides upon its center. Although by reason of the elevations of the mountains and the depressions of the valleys a perfect circle cannot be understood, yet this does not affect the general spherical nature of the earth. \u2026\nAs it has been already shown that the earth has the form of a sphere, we must consider whether a movement also coincides with this form, and what place the earth holds in the universe. \u2026 The great majority of authors of course agree that the earth stands still in the center of the universe, and consider it inconceivable and ridiculous to suppose the opposite. But if the matter is carefully weighed, it will be seen that the question is not yet settled and therefore by no means to be regarded lightly. Every change of place which is observed is due, namely, to a movement of the observed object or of the observer, or to movements of both. \u2026 Now it is from the earth that the revolution of the heavens is observed and it is produced for our eyes. Therefore if the earth undergoes no movement this movement must take place in everything outside of the earth, but in the opposite direction than if everything on the earth moved, and of this kind is the daily revolution. So this appears to affect the whole universe, that is, everything outside the earth with the single exception of the earth itself. If, however, one should admit that this movement was not peculiar to the heavens, but that the earth revolved from west to east, and if this was carefully considered in regard to the apparent rising and setting of the sun, the moon and the stars, it would be discovered that this was the real situation.\"\nNicolas Copernicus, The Revolutions of the Heavenly Bodies, 1543\nThe passage may be used as evidence that Copernicus differed from the traditional, Aristotelian natural philosophers of his day because he suggested that\nOptions:\nA. the cosmos is spherical\nB. the Earth is spherical\nC. the cosmos is geostatic\nD. the Earth is not stationary\nAnswer:", "options": ["the cosmos is spherical", "the Earth is spherical", "the cosmos is geostatic", "the Earth is not stationary"], "probs": [[0.4202260971069336, 0.2807610034942627, 0.15575528144836426, 0.14319539070129395], [0.39529943466186523, 0.27811622619628906, 0.16202735900878906, 0.16449499130249023], [0.3969433307647705, 0.2846229076385498, 0.15717291831970215, 0.16113734245300293], [0.39179134368896484, 0.2836320400238037, 0.1630418300628662, 0.1613919734954834], [0.39301180839538574, 0.2868349552154541, 0.1303844451904297, 0.18964219093322754], [0.4118015766143799, 0.28726887702941895, 0.1288759708404541, 0.17225861549377441], [0.42948102951049805, 0.28146815299987793, 0.14336347579956055, 0.1457524299621582], [0.3977327346801758, 0.2832331657409668, 0.15650415420532227, 0.1625373363494873], [0.4245786666870117, 0.293684720993042, 0.1506948471069336, 0.13132119178771973], [0.41849327087402344, 0.29102563858032227, 0.1594223976135254, 0.13098692893981934], [0.416471004486084, 0.2929394245147705, 0.13148117065429688, 0.15895700454711914], [0.4416320323944092, 0.2833576202392578, 0.12478780746459961, 0.15013861656188965], [0.3798341751098633, 0.2968473434448242, 0.14835572242736816, 0.17494702339172363], [0.3558485507965088, 0.29827046394348145, 0.1605684757232666, 0.18533539772033691], [0.4023315906524658, 0.2934231758117676, 0.15288758277893066, 0.1512366533279419], [0.383774995803833, 0.29491353034973145, 0.16234135627746582, 0.15896916389465332], [0.35944700241088867, 0.3199906349182129, 0.13973689079284668, 0.1808009147644043], [0.35287046432495117, 0.31316661834716797, 0.13730764389038086, 0.19670486450195312], [0.4032893180847168, 0.26946258544921875, 0.1388249397277832, 0.1884171962738037], [0.4093818664550781, 0.271620512008667, 0.1375741958618164, 0.18143177032470703], [0.40964579582214355, 0.2675044536590576, 0.14886021614074707, 0.17398762702941895], [0.4030308723449707, 0.26451873779296875, 0.1520099639892578, 0.18032550811767578], [0.371685266494751, 0.29433727264404297, 0.160797119140625, 0.17323899269104004], [0.3683016300201416, 0.28947997093200684, 0.16523432731628418, 0.17680978775024414]], "ideal": "D"}}

They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you.

So no one will doubt that this form belongs to the heavenly bodies. \u2026\nThat the earth is also spherical is therefore beyond question, because it presses from all sides upon its center. Although by reason of the elevations of the mountains and the depressions of the valleys a perfect circle cannot be understood, yet this does not affect the general spherical nature of the earth. \u2026\nAs it has been already shown that the earth has the form of a sphere, we must consider whether a movement also coincides with this form, and what place the earth holds in the universe. \u2026 The great majority of authors of course agree that the earth stands still in the center of the universe, and consider it inconceivable and ridiculous to suppose the opposite. But if the matter is carefully weighed, it will be seen that the question is not yet settled and therefore by no means to be regarded lightly. Every change of place which is observed is due, namely, to a movement of the observed object or of the observer, or to movements of both. \u2026 Now it is from the earth that the revolution of the heavens is observed and it is produced for our eyes. Therefore if the earth undergoes no movement this movement must take place in everything outside of the earth, but in the opposite direction than if everything on the earth moved, and of this kind is the daily revolution. So this appears to affect the whole universe, that is, everything outside the earth with the single exception of the earth itself. If, however, one should admit that this movement was not peculiar to the heavens, but that the earth revolved from west to east, and if this was carefully considered in regard to the apparent rising and setting of the sun, the moon and the stars, it would be discovered that this was the real situation.\"\nNicolas Copernicus, The Revolutions of the Heavenly Bodies, 1543\nFrom the passage, one could argue that Copernicus was working in\nOptions:\nA. the Aristotelian tradition\nB. the natural magic tradition\nC. the skeptical tradition\nD. the Platonic/Pythagorean tradition\nAnswer:", "options": ["the Aristotelian tradition", "the natural magic tradition", "the skeptical tradition", "the Platonic/Pythagorean tradition"], "probs": [[0.4044673442840576, 0.2949070930480957, 0.16130328178405762, 0.13922202587127686], [0.40270233154296875, 0.3031585216522217, 0.17677640914916992, 0.117270827293396], [0.39907336235046387, 0.2973330020904541, 0.15663719177246094, 0.14679217338562012], [0.39463114738464355, 0.3050994873046875, 0.1705336570739746, 0.12979137897491455], [0.39780449867248535, 0.3094947338104248, 0.1782207489013672, 0.11439025402069092], [0.39511990547180176, 0.3102269172668457, 0.17700529098510742, 0.11744499206542969], [0.4179399013519287, 0.29055166244506836, 0.15058326721191406, 0.14083290100097656], [0.4178779125213623, 0.2992837429046631, 0.16482925415039062, 0.11783504486083984], [0.40621089935302734, 0.28615760803222656, 0.15437817573547363, 0.15330290794372559], [0.39955663681030273, 0.29245877265930176, 0.16643881797790527, 0.14143133163452148], [0.3966104984283447, 0.30588817596435547, 0.18402338027954102, 0.11361575126647949], [0.39734458923339844, 0.3009965419769287, 0.1770622730255127, 0.12461507320404053], [0.3898284435272217, 0.3008084297180176, 0.1535036563873291, 0.1557384729385376], [0.3887970447540283, 0.3083171844482422, 0.16518640518188477, 0.13775181770324707], [0.38495659828186035, 0.2959556579589844, 0.16295528411865234, 0.15612125396728516], [0.37976598739624023, 0.3022499084472656, 0.1735367774963379, 0.1443701982498169], [0.36825990676879883, 0.3070981502532959, 0.19819903373718262, 0.12638258934020996], [0.37168097496032715, 0.3027005195617676, 0.1928250789642334, 0.13274085521697998], [0.40488672256469727, 0.3395729064941406, 0.14972877502441406, 0.10571599006652832], [0.4048879146575928, 0.33834290504455566, 0.14740681648254395, 0.10944151878356934], [0.39414501190185547, 0.3339710235595703, 0.16722869873046875, 0.10468411445617676], [0.3963446617126465, 0.3293192386627197, 0.15916085243225098, 0.11507058143615723], [0.3892495632171631, 0.3288145065307617, 0.16880536079406738, 0.11316883563995361], [0.3929131031036377, 0.32515430450439453, 0.16343021392822266, 0.11848795413970947]], "ideal": "C"}}

I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.\nThe circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.\nI believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.\nI believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.\nI do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: \"I do not know him\"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, \"He is a man I never see\"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.\nNo one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.\nHe loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him.

They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you.

Yet we may be allowed to doubt whether the union was not a little too speedy and a little too thorough. It is surely carrying unity too far to wipe out all traces of the independent being, for most purposes to wipe out the very name, of such a land as Sicily. It jars on our feelings to find that, while Ireland at least forms part of the royal style of its sovereign, Sicily is no longer even a geographical expression. The island realm of Roger has sunk to be seven provinces of the kingdom on the mainland. And there is another result of Italian unity, a result in which we may rejoice without drawbacks, but which still has somewhat of sadness about it as finally ending that great phase of the history of Europe with which we have throughout been dealing. Never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Italy entered liberated Rome. Of all novelties in European history the greatest was when Rome became the centre of a dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds, the head in short of a local Italian kingdom. \"Rome the capital of Italy\" was a formula which might well gladden our hearts; but it was a formula which formally swept away the \u0153cumenical position, the \u0153cumenical traditions, of Rome&\u2026.\nBut the kingdom of Italy is not an appendage to Rome; Rome is the head of the kingdom. The whole is greater than its part; Rome, by her own free will and by the free will of Italy, has become less than Italy. By becoming the willing head of an Italian kingdom she has formally cast aside her Imperial traditions as they were not cast aside when brute force made her the head of a French department.\"\nEdward A. Freeman, British historian and politician, The Chief Periods of European History, 1885\nAccording to the author, Italy's connections to its history and traditions were most \"fully snapped\" when\nOptions:\nA.

Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

The conquest of Europe by Napoleon led to the creation of new factions and shifted the European balance of power.\nC. The power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur.\nD. The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery!

He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you.

It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones. Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinctive feature: it has simplified the class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes, directly facing each other: Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.\nKarl Marx and Friedrich Engels, The Communist Manifesto, 1848\nThe Communist Manifesto can be understood as an example of the influence of which mode of modern European thinking?\nOptions:\nA.

If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: \"I do not know him\"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, \"He is a man I never see\"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.\nNo one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.\nHe loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him. Motives of policy had something to do with this; by making expensive habits the fashion, and, for people in a certain position, a necessity, he compelled his courtiers to live beyond their income, and gradually reduced them to depend on his bounty for the means of subsistence.\n\u2014Duke Saint-Simon, Memoirs of Louis XIV and His Court and His Regency, c. 1750\nWhich of the following was the greatest weakness and regret of the rule of King Louis XIV?\nOptions:\nA.

His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

The power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur.\nD. The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

You should directly answer the question by choosing the correct option.\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nThe following excerpt is from a pamphlet.\nYou will do me the justice to remember, that I have always strenuously supported the Right of every man to his own opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine. He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.\nThe most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.\nThe circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.\nI believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.\nI believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.\nI do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.\nAll national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.\nI do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine.\n\u2014Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason, 1794\u20131795\nWhich of the following Enlightenment philosophes designed a system of checks and balances for government to avoid abuses of power?\nOptions:\nA.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

They served as a catalyst for the growth of English shipping and overseas trade, but did little to limit the prospects of the Dutch in the seventeenth century.\nB. They brought about almost immediate hardships for the Dutch economy as their dominance of overseas trade quickly ended.\nC. They were rescinded during the restoration of the Stuarts as they sought normal diplomatic relations with the Dutch so not as to need Parliament's financial support for war.\nD.

It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones.

They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

You should directly answer the question by choosing the correct option.\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nThe following excerpt is from a pamphlet.\nYou will do me the justice to remember, that I have always strenuously supported the Right of every man to his own opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine. He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.\nThe most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.\nThe circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.\nI believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.\nI believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.\nI do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.\nAll national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.\nI do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine.\n\u2014Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason, 1794\u20131795\nWhich of the following Enlightenment philosophes designed a system of checks and balances for government to avoid abuses of power?\nOptions:\nA.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that?

You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA. The ideas of personal liberty and nationalism conceived during the Enlightenment resulted in radical revolutions that could spread throughout Europe.\nB. The conquest of Europe by Napoleon led to the creation of new factions and shifted the European balance of power.\nC. The power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur.\nD. The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA. Capitalist\nB. Scientific\nC. Communist\nD.

They served as a catalyst for the growth of English shipping and overseas trade, but did little to limit the prospects of the Dutch in the seventeenth century.\nB. They brought about almost immediate hardships for the Dutch economy as their dominance of overseas trade quickly ended.\nC. They were rescinded during the restoration of the Stuarts as they sought normal diplomatic relations with the Dutch so not as to need Parliament's financial support for war.\nD. They led to nearly a century of recurrent war between England and the Netherlands, which would not end until after American independence.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nAlbeit the king's Majesty justly and rightfully is and ought to be the supreme head of the Church of England, and so is recognized by the clergy of this realm in their convocations, yet nevertheless, for corroboration and confirmation thereof, and for increase of virtue in Christ's religion within this realm of England, and to repress and extirpate all errors, heresies, and other enormities and abuses heretofore used in the same, be it enacted, by authority of this present Parliament, that the king, our sovereign lord, his heirs and successors, kings of this realm, shall be taken, accepted, and reputed the only supreme head in earth of the Church of England, called Anglicans Ecclesia; and shall have and enjoy, annexed and united to the imperial crown of this realm, as well the title and style thereof, as all honors, dignities, preeminences, jurisdictions, privileges, authorities, immunities, profits, and commodities to the said dignity of the supreme head of the same Church belonging and appertaining; and that our said sovereign lord, his heirs and successors, kings of this realm, shall have full power and authority from time to time to visit, repress, redress, record, order, correct, restrain, and amend all such errors, heresies, abuses, offenses, contempts, and enormities, whatsoever they be, which by any manner of spiritual authority or jurisdiction ought or may lawfully be reformed, repressed, ordered, redressed, corrected, restrained, or amended, most to the pleasure of Almighty God, the increase of virtue in Christ's religion, and for the conservation of the peace, unity, and tranquility of this realm; any usage, foreign land, foreign authority, prescription, or any other thing or things to the contrary hereof notwithstanding.\nEnglish Parliament, Act of Supremacy, 1534\nFrom the passage, one may infer that the English Parliament wished to argue that the Act of Supremacy would\nOptions:\nA. give the English king a new position of authority\nB. give the position of head of the Church of England to Henry VIII alone and exclude his heirs\nC. establish Calvinism as the one true theology in England\nD. end various forms of corruption plaguing the Church in England\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\n\"Buckingham Palace, 10th May 1839.\nThe Queen forgot to ask Lord Melbourne if he thought there would be any harm in her writing to the Duke of Cambridge that she really was fearful of fatiguing herself, if she went out to a party at Gloucester House on Tuesday, an Ancient Concert on Wednesday, and a ball at Northumberland House on Thursday, considering how much she had to do these last four days. If she went to the Ancient Concert on Wednesday, having besides a concert of her own here on Monday, it would be four nights of fatigue, really exhausted as the Queen is.\nBut if Lord Melbourne thinks that as there are only to be English singers at the Ancient Concert, she ought to go, she could go there for one act; but she would much rather, if possible, get out of it, for it is a fatiguing time&\u2026.\nAs the negotiations with the Tories are quite at an end, and Lord Melbourne has been here, the Queen hopes Lord Melbourne will not object to dining with her on Sunday?\"\nThe Letters of Queen Victoria, Volume 1 (of 3), 1837-1843: A Selection from Her Majesty's Correspondence Between the Years 1837 and 1861\nThe long evenings of entertainment for Queen Victoria suggest what about the nature of the English monarchy in the nineteenth century?\nOptions:\nA.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

They served as a catalyst for the growth of English shipping and overseas trade, but did little to limit the prospects of the Dutch in the seventeenth century.\nB. They brought about almost immediate hardships for the Dutch economy as their dominance of overseas trade quickly ended.\nC. They were rescinded during the restoration of the Stuarts as they sought normal diplomatic relations with the Dutch so not as to need Parliament's financial support for war.\nD.

By 1920 that fear was beginning to recede and Addison's policy was being regarded as extravagant. An immediate victim of the new attitude was the Borough's Kingfield Street scheme, provisional plans for which were approved in September 1920. Much to the Council's surprise, the Government's Housing Board deferred the scheme, \"having regard to the Council's present commitments and the money available at the present time, and in May 1921 the Government announced a drastic curtailment of the housing programme, cutting the housing target by half.\n\u2014Excerpt from a work by English historian Hermione Hobhouse Public Housing in Poplar: The Inter-war Years, 1994\nWhich of the following attitudes prevalent after the First World War is evident in the passage above?\nOptions:\nA.

The conquest of Europe by Napoleon led to the creation of new factions and shifted the European balance of power.\nC. The power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur.\nD. The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

They served as a catalyst for the growth of English shipping and overseas trade, but did little to limit the prospects of the Dutch in the seventeenth century.\nB. They brought about almost immediate hardships for the Dutch economy as their dominance of overseas trade quickly ended.\nC. They were rescinded during the restoration of the Stuarts as they sought normal diplomatic relations with the Dutch so not as to need Parliament's financial support for war.\nD. They led to nearly a century of recurrent war between England and the Netherlands, which would not end until after American independence.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nAlbeit the king's Majesty justly and rightfully is and ought to be the supreme head of the Church of England, and so is recognized by the clergy of this realm in their convocations, yet nevertheless, for corroboration and confirmation thereof, and for increase of virtue in Christ's religion within this realm of England, and to repress and extirpate all errors, heresies, and other enormities and abuses heretofore used in the same, be it enacted, by authority of this present Parliament, that the king, our sovereign lord, his heirs and successors, kings of this realm, shall be taken, accepted, and reputed the only supreme head in earth of the Church of England, called Anglicans Ecclesia; and shall have and enjoy, annexed and united to the imperial crown of this realm, as well the title and style thereof, as all honors, dignities, preeminences, jurisdictions, privileges, authorities, immunities, profits, and commodities to the said dignity of the supreme head of the same Church belonging and appertaining; and that our said sovereign lord, his heirs and successors, kings of this realm, shall have full power and authority from time to time to visit, repress, redress, record, order, correct, restrain, and amend all such errors, heresies, abuses, offenses, contempts, and enormities, whatsoever they be, which by any manner of spiritual authority or jurisdiction ought or may lawfully be reformed, repressed, ordered, redressed, corrected, restrained, or amended, most to the pleasure of Almighty God, the increase of virtue in Christ's religion, and for the conservation of the peace, unity, and tranquility of this realm; any usage, foreign land, foreign authority, prescription, or any other thing or things to the contrary hereof notwithstanding.\nEnglish Parliament, Act of Supremacy, 1534\nFrom the passage, one may infer that the English Parliament wished to argue that the Act of Supremacy would\nOptions:\nA. give the English king a new position of authority\nB. give the position of head of the Church of England to Henry VIII alone and exclude his heirs\nC. establish Calvinism as the one true theology in England\nD. end various forms of corruption plaguing the Church in England\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nRead the following quote.\nI had now decided beyond all question that there existed in the heavens three stars wandering about Jupiter as do Venus and Mercury about the sun, and this became plainer than daylight from observations on similar occasions which followed. Nor were there just three such stars; four wanderers complete their revolutions about Jupiter, and of their alterations as observed more precisely later on we shall give a description here. Also I measured the distances between them by means of the telescope. . . .\nSuch are the observations concerning the four Medicean planets recently first discovered by me, and although from this data their periods have not yet been reconstructed in numerical form, it is legitimate at least to put in evidence some facts worthy of note. Above all, since they sometimes follow and sometimes precede Jupiter by the same intervals, and they remain within very limited distances either to east or west of Jupiter, accompanying that planet in both its retrograde and direct movements in a constant manner, no one can doubt that they complete their revolutions about Jupiter and at the same time effect all together a twelve-year period about the center of the universe.\n\u2014Galileo Galilei, 1610\nWhich of the following is best demonstrated by the passage about intellectual thought at the time?\nOptions:\nA.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you.

Lenin.\nThe independence of our country cannot be upheld unless we have an adequate industrial basis for defense. And such an industrial basis cannot be created if our industry is not more highly developed technically. That is why a fast rate of development of our industry is necessary and imperative. We cannot go on indefinitely, that is, for too long a period, basing the Soviet regime and socialist construction on two different foundations, the foundation of the most large-scale and united socialist industry and the foundation of the most scattered and backward, small commodity economy of the peasants. We must gradually, but systematically and persistently, place our agriculture on a new technical basis, the basis of large-scale production, and bring it up to the level of socialist industry. Either we accomplish this task\u2014in which case the final victory of socialism in our country will be assured, or we turn away from it and do not accomplish it\u2014in which case a return to capitalism may become inevitable.\n\u2014Vladimir I.

They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything!

You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you.

The power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur.\nD. The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you.

His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

We must gradually, but systematically and persistently, place our agriculture on a new technical basis, the basis of large-scale production, and bring it up to the level of socialist industry. Either we accomplish this task\u2014in which case the final victory of socialism in our country will be assured, or we turn away from it and do not accomplish it\u2014in which case a return to capitalism may become inevitable.\n\u2014Vladimir I.

His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

He began with making a crucial incision on me from the navel to the clavicula. One could not have been worse hanged than I was. The executioner of the Holy Inquisition was a sub-deacon, and knew how to burn people marvellously well, but he was not accustomed to hanging. The cord was wet and did not slip properly, and besides it was badly tied; in short, I still drew my breath, when the crucial incision made me give such a frightful scream that my surgeon fell flat upon his back&\u2026[At length he] sewed up my wounds; his wife even nursed me. I was upon my legs at the end of fifteen days&\u2026.\nOne day I took it into my head to step into a mosque, where I saw an old Iman and a very pretty young devotee who was saying her paternosters&\u2026.She dropped her bouquet; I picked it up, and presented it to her with a profound reverence. I was so long in delivering it that the Iman began to get angry, and seeing that I was a Christian he called out for help. They carried me before the cadi, who ordered me a hundred lashes on the soles of the feet and sent me to the galleys. I was chained to the very same galley and the same bench as the young Baron. On board this galley there were four young men from Marseilles, five Neapolitan priests, and two monks from Corfu, who told us similar adventures happened daily. The Baron maintained that he had suffered greater injustice than I&\u2026.We were continually disputing, and received twenty lashes with a bull's pizzle when the concatenation of universal events brought you to our galley, and you were good enough to ransom us.\"\n\"Well, my dear Pangloss,\" said Candide to him, \"when you had been hanged, dissected, whipped, and were tugging at the oar, did you always think that everything happens for the best?\"\n\"I am still of my first opinion,\" answered Pangloss, \"for I am a philosopher and I cannot retract, especially as Leibnitz could never be wrong; and besides, the pre-established harmony is the finest thing in the world, and so is his plenum and materia subtilis.\"\nVoltaire, French Enlightenment writer, Candide, 1759\nThe critiques offered by Voltaire through Candide are most closely shared by what other philosopher?\nOptions:\nA.

His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

They served as a catalyst for the growth of English shipping and overseas trade, but did little to limit the prospects of the Dutch in the seventeenth century.\nB. They brought about almost immediate hardships for the Dutch economy as their dominance of overseas trade quickly ended.\nC. They were rescinded during the restoration of the Stuarts as they sought normal diplomatic relations with the Dutch so not as to need Parliament's financial support for war.\nD.

In ascribing the salvation of the remnant of the people to the election of grace, Paul clearly testifies, that it is then only known that God saves whom upon which there can be no claim. They who shut the gates to prevent anyone from presuming to approach and taste this doctrine, do no less injury to man than to God; for nothing else will be sufficient to produce in us suitable humility, or to impress us with a due sense of our great obligations to God. Nor is there any other basis for solid confidence, even according to the authority of Christ, who, to deliver us from all fear, and render us invincible amidst so many dangers, snares, and deadly conflicts, promises to preserve in safety all whom the Father has committed to His care.\n\u2014John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, 1559\nWhich of the following religions that started around the same time as Calvinism was destroyed for supporting adult baptism and pacifism?\nOptions:\nA.

All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.\nThe most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.\nThe circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.\nI believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.\nI believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.\nI do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.\nAll national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.\nI do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine.\n\u2014Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason, 1794\u20131795\nWhich of the following Enlightenment philosophes designed a system of checks and balances for government to avoid abuses of power?\nOptions:\nA.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering.

You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you.

He began with making a crucial incision on me from the navel to the clavicula. One could not have been worse hanged than I was. The executioner of the Holy Inquisition was a sub-deacon, and knew how to burn people marvellously well, but he was not accustomed to hanging. The cord was wet and did not slip properly, and besides it was badly tied; in short, I still drew my breath, when the crucial incision made me give such a frightful scream that my surgeon fell flat upon his back&\u2026[At length he] sewed up my wounds; his wife even nursed me.

I was so long in delivering it that the Iman began to get angry, and seeing that I was a Christian he called out for help. They carried me before the cadi, who ordered me a hundred lashes on the soles of the feet and sent me to the galleys. I was chained to the very same galley and the same bench as the young Baron. On board this galley there were four young men from Marseilles, five Neapolitan priests, and two monks from Corfu, who told us similar adventures happened daily.

It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.\nUntil this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively.

They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering.

You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you.

It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.\nUntil this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.\nErasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all.\"\nJohan Huizinga, twentieth-century Dutch philosopher, Erasmus and the Age of Reformation, 1924\nHuizinga's apparent support of Erasmus' belief in the \"book of antiquity\" being \"open to all\" is most likely a product of\nOptions:\nA. the author's life as a member of twentieth-century Europe, which prized such characteristics\nB. the longevity of Erasmus' works\nC. the Dutch reverence for the works of Erasmus\nD. the typical unflinching support of one philosopher for another philosopher's work\nAnswer:", "options": ["the author's life as a member of twentieth-century Europe, which prized such characteristics", "the longevity of Erasmus' works", "the Dutch reverence for the works of Erasmus", "the typical unflinching support of one philosopher for another philosopher's work"], "probs": [[0.3527979850769043, 0.2490863800048828, 0.18608856201171875, 0.21212196350097656], [0.36434078216552734, 0.2639780044555664, 0.21121597290039062, 0.1602916717529297], [0.3380918502807617, 0.2511272430419922, 0.1704235076904297, 0.2403125762939453], [0.3677401542663574, 0.26854419708251953, 0.20810222625732422, 0.1555943489074707], [0.36484384536743164, 0.2684211730957031, 0.1804342269897461, 0.1863117218017578], [0.37920522689819336, 0.2702207565307617, 0.1884469985961914, 0.16228961944580078], [0.3425431251525879, 0.24132919311523438, 0.18410682678222656, 0.23197269439697266], [0.3558025360107422, 0.2573375701904297, 0.2040996551513672, 0.18288803100585938], [0.3403744697570801, 0.24126243591308594, 0.20200347900390625, 0.2163372039794922], [0.35953521728515625, 0.24814605712890625, 0.20979785919189453, 0.18258285522460938], [0.37077951431274414, 0.2603263854980469, 0.20562744140625, 0.1631450653076172], [0.36708927154541016, 0.24492549896240234, 0.18761253356933594, 0.20021533966064453], [0.33855581283569336, 0.24002742767333984, 0.17333316802978516, 0.2480754852294922], [0.3694443702697754, 0.2535543441772461, 0.20589160919189453, 0.17114782333374023], [0.34787750244140625, 0.2335643768310547, 0.21785259246826172, 0.20066547393798828], [0.3636159896850586, 0.2394552230834961, 0.220977783203125, 0.1758594512939453], [0.383364200592041, 0.2574434280395508, 0.19818592071533203, 0.16116571426391602], [0.3601508140563965, 0.24851608276367188, 0.17224884033203125, 0.2191457748413086], [0.36451196670532227, 0.2533073425292969, 0.19030475616455078, 0.1916813850402832], [0.37668800354003906, 0.2541656494140625, 0.19835853576660156, 0.17101383209228516], [0.36720895767211914, 0.2391977310180664, 0.23470115661621094, 0.1589508056640625], [0.370147705078125, 0.2289724349975586, 0.20263099670410156, 0.19835186004638672], [0.3722958564758301, 0.24683284759521484, 0.21439743041992188, 0.16637706756591797], [0.36083316802978516, 0.2377758026123047, 0.17889118194580078, 0.22237396240234375]], "ideal": "A"}}

Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA. The ideas of personal liberty and nationalism conceived during the Enlightenment resulted in radical revolutions that could spread throughout Europe.\nB. The conquest of Europe by Napoleon led to the creation of new factions and shifted the European balance of power.\nC. The power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur.\nD. The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

Existentialist\nAnswer: C\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nThe excerpts below are from the Navigation Acts of 1651.\n[A]fter the first day of December, one thousand six hundred fifty and one, and from thence forwards, no goods or commodities whatsoever of the growth, production or manufacture of Asia, Africa or America, or of any part thereof; or of any islands belonging to them, or which are described or laid down in the usual maps or cards of those places, as well of the English plantations as others, shall be imported or brought into this Commonwealth of England, or into Ireland, or any other lands, islands, plantations, or territories to this Commonwealth belonging, or in their possession, in any other ship or ships, vessel or vessels whatsoever, but only in such as do truly and without fraud belong only to the people of this Commonwealth, or the plantations thereof, as the proprietors or right owners thereof; and whereof the master and mariners are also of the people of this Commonwealth, under the penalty of the forfeiture and loss of all the goods that shall be imported contrary to this act, , , ,\n[N]o goods or commodities of the growth, production, or manufacture of Europe, or of any part thereof, shall after the first day of December, one thousand six hundred fifty and one, be imported or brought into this Commonwealth of England, or any other lands or territories to this Commonwealth belonging, or in their possession, in any ship or ships, vessel or vessels whatsoever, but in such as do truly and without fraud belong only to the people of this Commonwealth, and in no other, except only such foreign ships and vessels as do truly and properly belong to the people of that country or place, of which the said goods are the growth, production or manufacture.\nWhich of the following best describes the outcome of the Navigation Acts of 1651?\nOptions:\nA. They served as a catalyst for the growth of English shipping and overseas trade, but did little to limit the prospects of the Dutch in the seventeenth century.\nB. They brought about almost immediate hardships for the Dutch economy as their dominance of overseas trade quickly ended.\nC. They were rescinded during the restoration of the Stuarts as they sought normal diplomatic relations with the Dutch so not as to need Parliament's financial support for war.\nD. They led to nearly a century of recurrent war between England and the Netherlands, which would not end until after American independence.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nAlbeit the king's Majesty justly and rightfully is and ought to be the supreme head of the Church of England, and so is recognized by the clergy of this realm in their convocations, yet nevertheless, for corroboration and confirmation thereof, and for increase of virtue in Christ's religion within this realm of England, and to repress and extirpate all errors, heresies, and other enormities and abuses heretofore used in the same, be it enacted, by authority of this present Parliament, that the king, our sovereign lord, his heirs and successors, kings of this realm, shall be taken, accepted, and reputed the only supreme head in earth of the Church of England, called Anglicans Ecclesia; and shall have and enjoy, annexed and united to the imperial crown of this realm, as well the title and style thereof, as all honors, dignities, preeminences, jurisdictions, privileges, authorities, immunities, profits, and commodities to the said dignity of the supreme head of the same Church belonging and appertaining; and that our said sovereign lord, his heirs and successors, kings of this realm, shall have full power and authority from time to time to visit, repress, redress, record, order, correct, restrain, and amend all such errors, heresies, abuses, offenses, contempts, and enormities, whatsoever they be, which by any manner of spiritual authority or jurisdiction ought or may lawfully be reformed, repressed, ordered, redressed, corrected, restrained, or amended, most to the pleasure of Almighty God, the increase of virtue in Christ's religion, and for the conservation of the peace, unity, and tranquility of this realm; any usage, foreign land, foreign authority, prescription, or any other thing or things to the contrary hereof notwithstanding.\nEnglish Parliament, Act of Supremacy, 1534\nFrom the passage, one may infer that the English Parliament wished to argue that the Act of Supremacy would\nOptions:\nA. give the English king a new position of authority\nB. give the position of head of the Church of England to Henry VIII alone and exclude his heirs\nC. establish Calvinism as the one true theology in England\nD. end various forms of corruption plaguing the Church in England\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nThe pair of excerpts below is written by explorer Christopher Columbus and the Dominican Bishop of Chiapas, Mexico, Bartholomew de las Casas.\nSource 1\nIndians would give whatever the seller required. . . . Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.\n\u2014Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493\nSource 2\nIt was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.\n\u2014Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542\nThe free flow of plants and animals, as well as trade goods, between Europe and the Americas is referred to by historians as the Columbian Exchange, and affected the natives in which of the following ways?\nOptions:\nA.

His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

One would find it hard to imagine how the laws of movement cause such frightful disasters in the best of possible worlds. A hundred thousand ants, our fellows, crushed all at once in our ant-hill, and half of them perishing, no doubt in unspeakable agony, beneath the wreckage from which they cannot be drawn. Families ruined all over Europe, the fortune of a hundred businessmen, your compatriots, swallowed up in the ruins of Lisbon. What a wretched gamble is the game of human life! What will the preachers say, especially if the palace of the Inquisition is still standing? I flatter myself that at least the reverend father inquisitors have been crushed like others.

The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

You should directly answer the question by choosing the correct option.\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nThe following excerpt is from a pamphlet.\nYou will do me the justice to remember, that I have always strenuously supported the Right of every man to his own opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine. He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.\nThe most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.\nThe circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.\nI believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.\nI believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.\nI do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.\nAll national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.\nI do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine.\n\u2014Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason, 1794\u20131795\nWhich of the following Enlightenment philosophes designed a system of checks and balances for government to avoid abuses of power?\nOptions:\nA.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

A large number still remain, and to each of them it is only possible to dole out the least scrap of bread. We only give bread to those who would otherwise die. The staple dish here consists of mice, which the inhabitants hunt, so desperate are they from hunger. They devour roots which the animals cannot eat; one can, in fact, not put into words the things one sees. . . . This narrative, far from exaggerating, rather understates the horror of the case, for it does not record the hundredth part of the misery in this district. Those who have not witnessed it with their own eyes cannot imagine how great it is. Not a day passes but at least 200 people die of famine in the two provinces. We certify to having ourselves seen herds, not of cattle, but of men and women, wandering about the fields between Rheims and Rh\u00e9tel, turning up the earth like pigs to find a few roots; and as they can only find rotten ones, and not half enough of them, they become so weak that they have not strength left to seek food. The parish priest at Boult, whose letter we enclose, tells us he has buried three of his parishioners who died of hunger. The rest subsisted on chopped straw mixed with earth, of which they composed a food which cannot be called bread.

They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.\nThe most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.\nThe circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.\nI believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.\nI believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.\nI do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.\nAll national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.\nI do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine.\n\u2014Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason, 1794\u20131795\nWhich of the following Enlightenment philosophes designed a system of checks and balances for government to avoid abuses of power?\nOptions:\nA.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

The conquest of Europe by Napoleon led to the creation of new factions and shifted the European balance of power.\nC. The power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur.\nD. The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

They brought about almost immediate hardships for the Dutch economy as their dominance of overseas trade quickly ended.\nC.

His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

You should directly answer the question by choosing the correct option.\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nThe following excerpt is from a pamphlet.\nYou will do me the justice to remember, that I have always strenuously supported the Right of every man to his own opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine. He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.\nThe most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.\nThe circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.\nI believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.\nI believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.\nI do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.\nAll national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.\nI do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine.\n\u2014Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason, 1794\u20131795\nWhich of the following Enlightenment philosophes designed a system of checks and balances for government to avoid abuses of power?\nOptions:\nA.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

And such an industrial basis cannot be created if our industry is not more highly developed technically. That is why a fast rate of development of our industry is necessary and imperative. We cannot go on indefinitely, that is, for too long a period, basing the Soviet regime and socialist construction on two different foundations, the foundation of the most large-scale and united socialist industry and the foundation of the most scattered and backward, small commodity economy of the peasants. We must gradually, but systematically and persistently, place our agriculture on a new technical basis, the basis of large-scale production, and bring it up to the level of socialist industry.

His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

They served as a catalyst for the growth of English shipping and overseas trade, but did little to limit the prospects of the Dutch in the seventeenth century.\nB. They brought about almost immediate hardships for the Dutch economy as their dominance of overseas trade quickly ended.\nC. They were rescinded during the restoration of the Stuarts as they sought normal diplomatic relations with the Dutch so not as to need Parliament's financial support for war.\nD. They led to nearly a century of recurrent war between England and the Netherlands, which would not end until after American independence.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nAlbeit the king's Majesty justly and rightfully is and ought to be the supreme head of the Church of England, and so is recognized by the clergy of this realm in their convocations, yet nevertheless, for corroboration and confirmation thereof, and for increase of virtue in Christ's religion within this realm of England, and to repress and extirpate all errors, heresies, and other enormities and abuses heretofore used in the same, be it enacted, by authority of this present Parliament, that the king, our sovereign lord, his heirs and successors, kings of this realm, shall be taken, accepted, and reputed the only supreme head in earth of the Church of England, called Anglicans Ecclesia; and shall have and enjoy, annexed and united to the imperial crown of this realm, as well the title and style thereof, as all honors, dignities, preeminences, jurisdictions, privileges, authorities, immunities, profits, and commodities to the said dignity of the supreme head of the same Church belonging and appertaining; and that our said sovereign lord, his heirs and successors, kings of this realm, shall have full power and authority from time to time to visit, repress, redress, record, order, correct, restrain, and amend all such errors, heresies, abuses, offenses, contempts, and enormities, whatsoever they be, which by any manner of spiritual authority or jurisdiction ought or may lawfully be reformed, repressed, ordered, redressed, corrected, restrained, or amended, most to the pleasure of Almighty God, the increase of virtue in Christ's religion, and for the conservation of the peace, unity, and tranquility of this realm; any usage, foreign land, foreign authority, prescription, or any other thing or things to the contrary hereof notwithstanding.\nEnglish Parliament, Act of Supremacy, 1534\nFrom the passage, one may infer that the English Parliament wished to argue that the Act of Supremacy would\nOptions:\nA. give the English king a new position of authority\nB. give the position of head of the Church of England to Henry VIII alone and exclude his heirs\nC. establish Calvinism as the one true theology in England\nD. end various forms of corruption plaguing the Church in England\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nThe history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class struggles. \u2026 The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms. It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones. Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinctive feature: it has simplified the class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes, directly facing each other: Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.\nKarl Marx and Friedrich Engels, The Communist Manifesto, 1848\nMarx and Engels would be most inclined to view which of the following developments as a significant event in European history?\nOptions:\nA.

His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

They brought about almost immediate hardships for the Dutch economy as their dominance of overseas trade quickly ended.\nC. They were rescinded during the restoration of the Stuarts as they sought normal diplomatic relations with the Dutch so not as to need Parliament's financial support for war.\nD.

The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

In ascribing the salvation of the remnant of the people to the election of grace, Paul clearly testifies, that it is then only known that God saves whom upon which there can be no claim. They who shut the gates to prevent anyone from presuming to approach and taste this doctrine, do no less injury to man than to God; for nothing else will be sufficient to produce in us suitable humility, or to impress us with a due sense of our great obligations to God. Nor is there any other basis for solid confidence, even according to the authority of Christ, who, to deliver us from all fear, and render us invincible amidst so many dangers, snares, and deadly conflicts, promises to preserve in safety all whom the Father has committed to His care.\n\u2014John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, 1559\nWhich of the following beliefs, supported first by Calvin, does this passage seem to best support?\nOptions:\nA.

He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.\nThe most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.\nThe circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.\nI believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.\nI believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.\nI do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you.

His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.\nThe most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.\nThe circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.\nI believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.\nI believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.\nI do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

The conquest of Europe by Napoleon led to the creation of new factions and shifted the European balance of power.\nC. The power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur.\nD. The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA. Capitalist\nB. Scientific\nC. Communist\nD. Existentialist\nAnswer: C\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nThe excerpts below are from the Navigation Acts of 1651.\n[A]fter the first day of December, one thousand six hundred fifty and one, and from thence forwards, no goods or commodities whatsoever of the growth, production or manufacture of Asia, Africa or America, or of any part thereof; or of any islands belonging to them, or which are described or laid down in the usual maps or cards of those places, as well of the English plantations as others, shall be imported or brought into this Commonwealth of England, or into Ireland, or any other lands, islands, plantations, or territories to this Commonwealth belonging, or in their possession, in any other ship or ships, vessel or vessels whatsoever, but only in such as do truly and without fraud belong only to the people of this Commonwealth, or the plantations thereof, as the proprietors or right owners thereof; and whereof the master and mariners are also of the people of this Commonwealth, under the penalty of the forfeiture and loss of all the goods that shall be imported contrary to this act, , , ,\n[N]o goods or commodities of the growth, production, or manufacture of Europe, or of any part thereof, shall after the first day of December, one thousand six hundred fifty and one, be imported or brought into this Commonwealth of England, or any other lands or territories to this Commonwealth belonging, or in their possession, in any ship or ships, vessel or vessels whatsoever, but in such as do truly and without fraud belong only to the people of this Commonwealth, and in no other, except only such foreign ships and vessels as do truly and properly belong to the people of that country or place, of which the said goods are the growth, production or manufacture.\nWhich of the following best describes the outcome of the Navigation Acts of 1651?\nOptions:\nA. They served as a catalyst for the growth of English shipping and overseas trade, but did little to limit the prospects of the Dutch in the seventeenth century.\nB. They brought about almost immediate hardships for the Dutch economy as their dominance of overseas trade quickly ended.\nC. They were rescinded during the restoration of the Stuarts as they sought normal diplomatic relations with the Dutch so not as to need Parliament's financial support for war.\nD.

His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA. The ideas of personal liberty and nationalism conceived during the Enlightenment resulted in radical revolutions that could spread throughout Europe.\nB. The conquest of Europe by Napoleon led to the creation of new factions and shifted the European balance of power.\nC. The power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur.\nD. The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

The executioner of the Holy Inquisition was a sub-deacon, and knew how to burn people marvellously well, but he was not accustomed to hanging. The cord was wet and did not slip properly, and besides it was badly tied; in short, I still drew my breath, when the crucial incision made me give such a frightful scream that my surgeon fell flat upon his back&\u2026[At length he] sewed up my wounds; his wife even nursed me.

I was so long in delivering it that the Iman began to get angry, and seeing that I was a Christian he called out for help. They carried me before the cadi, who ordered me a hundred lashes on the soles of the feet and sent me to the galleys. I was chained to the very same galley and the same bench as the young Baron.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

The power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur.\nD. The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

They served as a catalyst for the growth of English shipping and overseas trade, but did little to limit the prospects of the Dutch in the seventeenth century.\nB. They brought about almost immediate hardships for the Dutch economy as their dominance of overseas trade quickly ended.\nC. They were rescinded during the restoration of the Stuarts as they sought normal diplomatic relations with the Dutch so not as to need Parliament's financial support for war.\nD. They led to nearly a century of recurrent war between England and the Netherlands, which would not end until after American independence.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nAlbeit the king's Majesty justly and rightfully is and ought to be the supreme head of the Church of England, and so is recognized by the clergy of this realm in their convocations, yet nevertheless, for corroboration and confirmation thereof, and for increase of virtue in Christ's religion within this realm of England, and to repress and extirpate all errors, heresies, and other enormities and abuses heretofore used in the same, be it enacted, by authority of this present Parliament, that the king, our sovereign lord, his heirs and successors, kings of this realm, shall be taken, accepted, and reputed the only supreme head in earth of the Church of England, called Anglicans Ecclesia; and shall have and enjoy, annexed and united to the imperial crown of this realm, as well the title and style thereof, as all honors, dignities, preeminences, jurisdictions, privileges, authorities, immunities, profits, and commodities to the said dignity of the supreme head of the same Church belonging and appertaining; and that our said sovereign lord, his heirs and successors, kings of this realm, shall have full power and authority from time to time to visit, repress, redress, record, order, correct, restrain, and amend all such errors, heresies, abuses, offenses, contempts, and enormities, whatsoever they be, which by any manner of spiritual authority or jurisdiction ought or may lawfully be reformed, repressed, ordered, redressed, corrected, restrained, or amended, most to the pleasure of Almighty God, the increase of virtue in Christ's religion, and for the conservation of the peace, unity, and tranquility of this realm; any usage, foreign land, foreign authority, prescription, or any other thing or things to the contrary hereof notwithstanding.\nEnglish Parliament, Act of Supremacy, 1534\nFrom the passage, one may infer that the English Parliament wished to argue that the Act of Supremacy would\nOptions:\nA. give the English king a new position of authority\nB. give the position of head of the Church of England to Henry VIII alone and exclude his heirs\nC. establish Calvinism as the one true theology in England\nD. end various forms of corruption plaguing the Church in England\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nThe situation is critical in the extreme. In fact it is now absolutely clear that to delay the uprising would be fatal.\nWith all my might I urge comrades to realize that everything now hangs by a thread; that we are confronted by problems which are not to be solved by conferences or congresses (even congresses of Soviets), but exclusively by peoples, by the masses, by the struggle of the armed people. \u2026\nWho must take power?

Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

The conquest of Europe by Napoleon led to the creation of new factions and shifted the European balance of power.\nC.

You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you.

I have instanced Louis the XVI, who loved the trade of locksmith; an Infanta of Spain preferred that of shoemaker; a certain king of Denmark gratified himself by manufacturing syringes; the former king of Naples loved to sell the fish he had caught in the market-place himself; the prince of Parma, whom Condillac had trained in metaphysical subtitles, in the understanding of intuition, of cognition, had no taste but for the occupation of church-warden and lay-brother.\nThe great majority of wealthy children would follow these plebeian tastes, if civilized education did not oppose the development of them; and if the filthiness of the workshops and the coarseness of the workmen did not arouse a repugnance stronger than the attraction. What child of a prince is there who has no taste for one of the four occupations I have just mentioned, that of mason, carpenter, smith, saddler, and who would not advance in them if he beheld from an early age the work carried on in blight workshops, by refined people, who would always arrange a miniature workshop for children, with little implements and light labor?\n\u2014Charles Fourier, On Education, 1838\nWhat nation experimented with utilizing the ideas of Fourier and others like him to create national workshops in 1848?\nOptions:\nA.

They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity.

All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything!

You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you.

The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

They served as a catalyst for the growth of English shipping and overseas trade, but did little to limit the prospects of the Dutch in the seventeenth century.\nB. They brought about almost immediate hardships for the Dutch economy as their dominance of overseas trade quickly ended.\nC. They were rescinded during the restoration of the Stuarts as they sought normal diplomatic relations with the Dutch so not as to need Parliament's financial support for war.\nD.

Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.\n\u2014Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493\nSource 2\nIt was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.\n\u2014Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542\nThe free flow of plants and animals, as well as trade goods, between Europe and the Americas is referred to by historians as the Columbian Exchange, and affected the Europeans in which of the following ways?\nOptions:\nA.

He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.\nThe most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.\nThe circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.\nI believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.\nI believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.\nI do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

The conquest of Europe by Napoleon led to the creation of new factions and shifted the European balance of power.\nC. The power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur.\nD. The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

Yet we may be allowed to doubt whether the union was not a little too speedy and a little too thorough. It is surely carrying unity too far to wipe out all traces of the independent being, for most purposes to wipe out the very name, of such a land as Sicily. It jars on our feelings to find that, while Ireland at least forms part of the royal style of its sovereign, Sicily is no longer even a geographical expression. The island realm of Roger has sunk to be seven provinces of the kingdom on the mainland. And there is another result of Italian unity, a result in which we may rejoice without drawbacks, but which still has somewhat of sadness about it as finally ending that great phase of the history of Europe with which we have throughout been dealing. Never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Italy entered liberated Rome. Of all novelties in European history the greatest was when Rome became the centre of a dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds, the head in short of a local Italian kingdom. \"Rome the capital of Italy\" was a formula which might well gladden our hearts; but it was a formula which formally swept away the \u0153cumenical position, the \u0153cumenical traditions, of Rome&\u2026.\nBut the kingdom of Italy is not an appendage to Rome; Rome is the head of the kingdom. The whole is greater than its part; Rome, by her own free will and by the free will of Italy, has become less than Italy. By becoming the willing head of an Italian kingdom she has formally cast aside her Imperial traditions as they were not cast aside when brute force made her the head of a French department.\"\nEdward A.

He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.\nThe most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.\nThe circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.\nI believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.\nI believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.\nI do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.\nThe circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.\nI believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.\nI believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.\nI do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of.

Adam Smith\nAnswer: B\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nRead the following excerpt.\nThe revolutionary seed had penetrated into every country and spread more or less. It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte.

Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth.

His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that?

You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you.

You should directly answer the question by choosing the correct option.\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nThe following excerpt is from a pamphlet.\nYou will do me the justice to remember, that I have always strenuously supported the Right of every man to his own opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine. He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.\nThe most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.\nThe circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.\nI believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.\nI believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.\nI do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.\nAll national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.\nI do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine.\n\u2014Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason, 1794\u20131795\nWhich of the following Enlightenment philosophes designed a system of checks and balances for government to avoid abuses of power?\nOptions:\nA.

Adam Smith\nAnswer: B\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nRead the following excerpt.\nThe revolutionary seed had penetrated into every country and spread more or less. It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA. The ideas of personal liberty and nationalism conceived during the Enlightenment resulted in radical revolutions that could spread throughout Europe.\nB. The conquest of Europe by Napoleon led to the creation of new factions and shifted the European balance of power.\nC. The power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur.\nD. The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA. Capitalist\nB. Scientific\nC. Communist\nD. Existentialist\nAnswer: C\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nThe excerpts below are from the Navigation Acts of 1651.\n[A]fter the first day of December, one thousand six hundred fifty and one, and from thence forwards, no goods or commodities whatsoever of the growth, production or manufacture of Asia, Africa or America, or of any part thereof; or of any islands belonging to them, or which are described or laid down in the usual maps or cards of those places, as well of the English plantations as others, shall be imported or brought into this Commonwealth of England, or into Ireland, or any other lands, islands, plantations, or territories to this Commonwealth belonging, or in their possession, in any other ship or ships, vessel or vessels whatsoever, but only in such as do truly and without fraud belong only to the people of this Commonwealth, or the plantations thereof, as the proprietors or right owners thereof; and whereof the master and mariners are also of the people of this Commonwealth, under the penalty of the forfeiture and loss of all the goods that shall be imported contrary to this act, , , ,\n[N]o goods or commodities of the growth, production, or manufacture of Europe, or of any part thereof, shall after the first day of December, one thousand six hundred fifty and one, be imported or brought into this Commonwealth of England, or any other lands or territories to this Commonwealth belonging, or in their possession, in any ship or ships, vessel or vessels whatsoever, but in such as do truly and without fraud belong only to the people of this Commonwealth, and in no other, except only such foreign ships and vessels as do truly and properly belong to the people of that country or place, of which the said goods are the growth, production or manufacture.\nWhich of the following best describes the outcome of the Navigation Acts of 1651?\nOptions:\nA. They served as a catalyst for the growth of English shipping and overseas trade, but did little to limit the prospects of the Dutch in the seventeenth century.\nB. They brought about almost immediate hardships for the Dutch economy as their dominance of overseas trade quickly ended.\nC. They were rescinded during the restoration of the Stuarts as they sought normal diplomatic relations with the Dutch so not as to need Parliament's financial support for war.\nD.

The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

They served as a catalyst for the growth of English shipping and overseas trade, but did little to limit the prospects of the Dutch in the seventeenth century.\nB. They brought about almost immediate hardships for the Dutch economy as their dominance of overseas trade quickly ended.\nC. They were rescinded during the restoration of the Stuarts as they sought normal diplomatic relations with the Dutch so not as to need Parliament's financial support for war.\nD.

Yet we may be allowed to doubt whether the union was not a little too speedy and a little too thorough. It is surely carrying unity too far to wipe out all traces of the independent being, for most purposes to wipe out the very name, of such a land as Sicily. It jars on our feelings to find that, while Ireland at least forms part of the royal style of its sovereign, Sicily is no longer even a geographical expression. The island realm of Roger has sunk to be seven provinces of the kingdom on the mainland. And there is another result of Italian unity, a result in which we may rejoice without drawbacks, but which still has somewhat of sadness about it as finally ending that great phase of the history of Europe with which we have throughout been dealing. Never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Italy entered liberated Rome. Of all novelties in European history the greatest was when Rome became the centre of a dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds, the head in short of a local Italian kingdom. \"Rome the capital of Italy\" was a formula which might well gladden our hearts; but it was a formula which formally swept away the \u0153cumenical position, the \u0153cumenical traditions, of Rome&\u2026.\nBut the kingdom of Italy is not an appendage to Rome; Rome is the head of the kingdom. The whole is greater than its part; Rome, by her own free will and by the free will of Italy, has become less than Italy. By becoming the willing head of an Italian kingdom she has formally cast aside her Imperial traditions as they were not cast aside when brute force made her the head of a French department.\"\nEdward A.

He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.\nThe most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.\nThe circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.\nI believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.\nI believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.\nI do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.\nThe most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.\nThe circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.\nI believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.\nI believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.\nI do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of.

Adam Smith\nAnswer: B\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nRead the following excerpt.\nThe revolutionary seed had penetrated into every country and spread more or less. It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

The conquest of Europe by Napoleon led to the creation of new factions and shifted the European balance of power.\nC. The power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur.\nD. The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

They served as a catalyst for the growth of English shipping and overseas trade, but did little to limit the prospects of the Dutch in the seventeenth century.\nB. They brought about almost immediate hardships for the Dutch economy as their dominance of overseas trade quickly ended.\nC. They were rescinded during the restoration of the Stuarts as they sought normal diplomatic relations with the Dutch so not as to need Parliament's financial support for war.\nD.

The genius of Napoleon is astounding. All branches of human knowledge seemed alike familiar to his gigantic mind. His conversations at St. Helena, scattered through the numerous and voluminous memorials of those who gleaned them, are replete with intensest interest. During the long agony of his imprisonment and his death, he conversed with perfect freedom upon the events of his marvelous career, and upon all those subjects or morals, politics, and religion, which most deeply concern the welfare of our race. There is no mind which will not be invigorated by familiarity with these profound thoughts, expressed with so much glow of feeling and energy of diction.\n\u2014John S. C.

He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

If I remain longer doing nothing, I am lost. In this great Babylon one reputation quickly succeeds another. After I have been seen three times at the theatre, I shall not be looked at again. I shall therefore not go very frequently. (diary, 1798)\nIf the press is not bridled, I shall not remain three days in power. (diary, 1799)\nThe presence of a general is necessary; he is the head, he is the all in all of an army. It was not the Roman army that conquered Gaul, it was Caesar, it was not the Carthaginians that made the armies of the Roman republic tremble at the very gates of Rome, it was Hannibal. (diary, 1801)\nMy power proceeds from my reputation, and my reputation from the victories I have won. My power would fall if I were not to support it with more glory and more victories. Conquest has made me what I am; only conquest can maintain me. (diary, 1802)\nThe revolution in France is over and now there is only one party in France and I shall never allow the newspapers to say anything contrary to my interests. They may publish a few little articles with just a bit of poison in them, but one fine day I shall shut their mouths forever.

You should directly answer the question by choosing the correct option.\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nThe following excerpt is from a pamphlet.\nYou will do me the justice to remember, that I have always strenuously supported the Right of every man to his own opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine. He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.\nThe most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.\nThe circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.\nI believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.\nI believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.\nI do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.\nAll national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.\nI do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine.\n\u2014Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason, 1794\u20131795\nWhich of the following Enlightenment philosophes designed a system of checks and balances for government to avoid abuses of power?\nOptions:\nA.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

They served as a catalyst for the growth of English shipping and overseas trade, but did little to limit the prospects of the Dutch in the seventeenth century.\nB. They brought about almost immediate hardships for the Dutch economy as their dominance of overseas trade quickly ended.\nC. They were rescinded during the restoration of the Stuarts as they sought normal diplomatic relations with the Dutch so not as to need Parliament's financial support for war.\nD.

Nor were there just three such stars; four wanderers complete their revolutions about Jupiter, and of their alterations as observed more precisely later on we shall give a description here. Also I measured the distances between them by means of the telescope. . . .\nSuch are the observations concerning the four Medicean planets recently first discovered by me, and although from this data their periods have not yet been reconstructed in numerical form, it is legitimate at least to put in evidence some facts worthy of note. Above all, since they sometimes follow and sometimes precede Jupiter by the same intervals, and they remain within very limited distances either to east or west of Jupiter, accompanying that planet in both its retrograde and direct movements in a constant manner, no one can doubt that they complete their revolutions about Jupiter and at the same time effect all together a twelve-year period about the center of the universe.\n\u2014Galileo Galilei, 1610\nWhich of the following conclusions drawn in part from the observations above was the most revolutionary over time?\nOptions:\nA. There were four smaller stars that seemed to move around Jupiter.\nB. The Earth is not the center of the universe.\nC.

The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

You should directly answer the question by choosing the correct option.\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nThe following excerpt is from a pamphlet.\nYou will do me the justice to remember, that I have always strenuously supported the Right of every man to his own opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine. He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.\nThe most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.\nThe circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.\nI believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.\nI believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.\nI do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.\nAll national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.\nI do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine.\n\u2014Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason, 1794\u20131795\nWhich of the following Enlightenment philosophes designed a system of checks and balances for government to avoid abuses of power?\nOptions:\nA.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

You should directly answer the question by choosing the correct option.\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nThe following excerpt is from a pamphlet.\nYou will do me the justice to remember, that I have always strenuously supported the Right of every man to his own opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine. He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.\nThe most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.\nThe circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.\nI believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.\nI believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.\nI do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of.

Adam Smith\nAnswer: B\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nRead the following excerpt.\nThe revolutionary seed had penetrated into every country and spread more or less. It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

The conquest of Europe by Napoleon led to the creation of new factions and shifted the European balance of power.\nC. The power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur.\nD. The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

Existentialist\nAnswer: C\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nThe excerpts below are from the Navigation Acts of 1651.\n[A]fter the first day of December, one thousand six hundred fifty and one, and from thence forwards, no goods or commodities whatsoever of the growth, production or manufacture of Asia, Africa or America, or of any part thereof; or of any islands belonging to them, or which are described or laid down in the usual maps or cards of those places, as well of the English plantations as others, shall be imported or brought into this Commonwealth of England, or into Ireland, or any other lands, islands, plantations, or territories to this Commonwealth belonging, or in their possession, in any other ship or ships, vessel or vessels whatsoever, but only in such as do truly and without fraud belong only to the people of this Commonwealth, or the plantations thereof, as the proprietors or right owners thereof; and whereof the master and mariners are also of the people of this Commonwealth, under the penalty of the forfeiture and loss of all the goods that shall be imported contrary to this act, , , ,\n[N]o goods or commodities of the growth, production, or manufacture of Europe, or of any part thereof, shall after the first day of December, one thousand six hundred fifty and one, be imported or brought into this Commonwealth of England, or any other lands or territories to this Commonwealth belonging, or in their possession, in any ship or ships, vessel or vessels whatsoever, but in such as do truly and without fraud belong only to the people of this Commonwealth, and in no other, except only such foreign ships and vessels as do truly and properly belong to the people of that country or place, of which the said goods are the growth, production or manufacture.\nWhich of the following best describes the outcome of the Navigation Acts of 1651?\nOptions:\nA. They served as a catalyst for the growth of English shipping and overseas trade, but did little to limit the prospects of the Dutch in the seventeenth century.\nB. They brought about almost immediate hardships for the Dutch economy as their dominance of overseas trade quickly ended.\nC. They were rescinded during the restoration of the Stuarts as they sought normal diplomatic relations with the Dutch so not as to need Parliament's financial support for war.\nD.

His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA.

You should directly answer the question by choosing the correct option.\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nThe following excerpt is from a pamphlet.\nYou will do me the justice to remember, that I have always strenuously supported the Right of every man to his own opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine. He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.\nThe most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.\nThe circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.\nI believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.\nI believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.\nI do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.\nAll national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.\nI do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine.\n\u2014Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason, 1794\u20131795\nWhich of the following Enlightenment philosophes designed a system of checks and balances for government to avoid abuses of power?\nOptions:\nA.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA.

{"type": "result", "data": {"idx": 164, "prompt": "The following are multiple choice questions about high school european history. You should directly answer the question by choosing the correct option.\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nThe following excerpt is from a pamphlet.\nYou will do me the justice to remember, that I have always strenuously supported the Right of every man to his own opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine. He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.\nThe most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.\nThe circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.\nI believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.\nI believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.\nI do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.\nAll national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.\nI do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine.\n\u2014Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason, 1794\u20131795\nWhich of the following Enlightenment philosophes designed a system of checks and balances for government to avoid abuses of power?\nOptions:\nA. Jean Jacques Rousseau\nB. Baron Montesquieu\nC. Mary Wollstonecraft\nD. Adam Smith\nAnswer: B\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nRead the following excerpt.\nThe revolutionary seed had penetrated into every country and spread more or less. It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nA. The ideas of personal liberty and nationalism conceived during the Enlightenment resulted in radical revolutions that could spread throughout Europe.\nB. The conquest of Europe by Napoleon led to the creation of new factions and shifted the European balance of power.\nC. The power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur.\nD. The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nA. Capitalist\nB. Scientific\nC. Communist\nD. Existentialist\nAnswer: C\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nThe excerpts below are from the Navigation Acts of 1651.\n[A]fter the first day of December, one thousand six hundred fifty and one, and from thence forwards, no goods or commodities whatsoever of the growth, production or manufacture of Asia, Africa or America, or of any part thereof; or of any islands belonging to them, or which are described or laid down in the usual maps or cards of those places, as well of the English plantations as others, shall be imported or brought into this Commonwealth of England, or into Ireland, or any other lands, islands, plantations, or territories to this Commonwealth belonging, or in their possession, in any other ship or ships, vessel or vessels whatsoever, but only in such as do truly and without fraud belong only to the people of this Commonwealth, or the plantations thereof, as the proprietors or right owners thereof; and whereof the master and mariners are also of the people of this Commonwealth, under the penalty of the forfeiture and loss of all the goods that shall be imported contrary to this act, , , ,\n[N]o goods or commodities of the growth, production, or manufacture of Europe, or of any part thereof, shall after the first day of December, one thousand six hundred fifty and one, be imported or brought into this Commonwealth of England, or any other lands or territories to this Commonwealth belonging, or in their possession, in any ship or ships, vessel or vessels whatsoever, but in such as do truly and without fraud belong only to the people of this Commonwealth, and in no other, except only such foreign ships and vessels as do truly and properly belong to the people of that country or place, of which the said goods are the growth, production or manufacture.\nWhich of the following best describes the outcome of the Navigation Acts of 1651?\nOptions:\nA. They served as a catalyst for the growth of English shipping and overseas trade, but did little to limit the prospects of the Dutch in the seventeenth century.\nB. They brought about almost immediate hardships for the Dutch economy as their dominance of overseas trade quickly ended.\nC. They were rescinded during the restoration of the Stuarts as they sought normal diplomatic relations with the Dutch so not as to need Parliament's financial support for war.\nD.
