If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: \"I do not know him\"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, \"He is a man I never see\"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.\nNo one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.\nHe loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him.

When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive.

or again because all the constituent parts of the universe, that is the sun, moon and the planets appear in this form; or because everything strives to attain this form, as appears in the case of drops of water and other fluid bodies if they attempt to define themselves. So no one will doubt that this form belongs to the heavenly bodies. \u2026\nThat the earth is also spherical is therefore beyond question, because it presses from all sides upon its center. Although by reason of the elevations of the mountains and the depressions of the valleys a perfect circle cannot be understood, yet this does not affect the general spherical nature of the earth. \u2026\nAs it has been already shown that the earth has the form of a sphere, we must consider whether a movement also coincides with this form, and what place the earth holds in the universe. \u2026 The great majority of authors of course agree that the earth stands still in the center of the universe, and consider it inconceivable and ridiculous to suppose the opposite. But if the matter is carefully weighed, it will be seen that the question is not yet settled and therefore by no means to be regarded lightly. Every change of place which is observed is due, namely, to a movement of the observed object or of the observer, or to movements of both. \u2026 Now it is from the earth that the revolution of the heavens is observed and it is produced for our eyes. Therefore if the earth undergoes no movement this movement must take place in everything outside of the earth, but in the opposite direction than if everything on the earth moved, and of this kind is the daily revolution. So this appears to affect the whole universe, that is, everything outside the earth with the single exception of the earth itself.

When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive.

A large number still remain, and to each of them it is only possible to dole out the least scrap of bread. We only give bread to those who would otherwise die. The staple dish here consists of mice, which the inhabitants hunt, so desperate are they from hunger. They devour roots which the animals cannot eat; one can, in fact, not put into words the things one sees. . . . This narrative, far from exaggerating, rather understates the horror of the case, for it does not record the hundredth part of the misery in this district. Those who have not witnessed it with their own eyes cannot imagine how great it is. Not a day passes but at least 200 people die of famine in the two provinces. We certify to having ourselves seen herds, not of cattle, but of men and women, wandering about the fields between Rheims and Rh\u00e9tel, turning up the earth like pigs to find a few roots; and as they can only find rotten ones, and not half enough of them, they become so weak that they have not strength left to seek food.

and particularly of what has been called the \"New Philosophy\" or \"Experimental Philosophy.\" We did by agreements \u2026 meet weekly in London on a certain day, to treat and discourse of such affairs. \u2026 Our business was (precluding matters of theology and state affairs), to discourse and consider of Philosophical Enquiries, and such as related thereunto: as physic, anatomy, geometry, astronomy, navigation, statics, magnetics, chemics, mechanics, and natural experiments; with the state of these studies, as then cultivated at home and abroad. We then discoursed of the circulation of the blood, the valves in the veins, the venae lactae, the lymphatic vessels, the Copernican hypothesis, the nature of comets and new stars, the satellites of Jupiter, the oval shape (as it then appeared) of Saturn, the spots in the sun, and its turning on its own axis, the inequalities and selenography of the moon, the several phases of Venus and Mercury, the improvement of telescopes, and grinding of glasses for that purpose, the weight of air, the possibility, or impossibility of vacuities, and nature's abhorrence thereof, the Torricellian experiment in quicksilver, the descent of heavy bodies, and the degrees of acceleration therein; and divers other things of like nature. Some of which were then but new discoveries, and others not so generally known and embraced, as now they are. \u2026\nWe barred all discourses of divinity, of state affairs, and of news, other than what concerned our business of Philosophy. These meetings we removed soon after to the Bull Head in Cheapside, and in term-time to Gresham College, where we met weekly at Mr. Foster's lecture (then Astronomy Professor there), and, after the lecture ended, repaired, sometimes to Mr. Foster's lodgings, sometimes to some other place not far distant, where we continued such enquiries, and our numbers increased.\nDr. John Wallis, Account of Some Passages of his Life, 1700\nThe passage may be used as evidence for the development of\nOptions:\nan independent society for the study of natural philosophy in the seventeenth century\nthe study of natural philosophy in the royal courts in the seventeenth century\nnew universities for the study of natural philosophy in the seventeenth century\nthe study of natural philosophy in the Church in the seventeenth century\nAnswer:", "options": ["an independent society for the study of natural philosophy in the seventeenth century", "the study of natural philosophy in the royal courts in the seventeenth century", "new universities for the study of natural philosophy in the seventeenth century", "the study of natural philosophy in the Church in the seventeenth century"], "lengths": [15, 15, 15, 14], "losses": [0.2807002365589142, 0.17846395075321198, 0.2508147358894348, 0.524330198764801], "probs": [0.2549876005566137, 0.282435782034563, 0.262723045760411, 0.19985357162016873], "sampled": "B", "ideal": "A", "correct": false}}

It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.\nUntil this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.\nErasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all.\"\nJohan Huizinga, twentieth-century Dutch philosopher, Erasmus and the Age of Reformation, 1924\nAccording to Huizinga, Erasmus's legacy was more significant than that of earlier humanists because\nOptions:\nhe had more support from the Church\nhe wrote in a language that was understandable to the masses, unlike his predecessors\nhe wrote exclusively about religious matters\nhe valued educating the masses more than his predecessors had\nAnswer:", "options": ["he had more support from the Church", "he wrote in a language that was understandable to the masses, unlike his predecessors", "he wrote exclusively about religious matters", "he valued educating the masses more than his predecessors had"], "lengths": [7, 18, 7, 14], "losses": [0.3466964364051819, 0.02575746551156044, 0.21147631108760834, 0.2644790709018707], "probs": [0.21697141822341104, 0.2990780578918171, 0.24838643943606867, 0.2355640844187954], "sampled": "B", "ideal": "D", "correct": false}}

I was so long in delivering it that the Iman began to get angry, and seeing that I was a Christian he called out for help. They carried me before the cadi, who ordered me a hundred lashes on the soles of the feet and sent me to the galleys. I was chained to the very same galley and the same bench as the young Baron.

The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.\n\u2014Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542\nWhich of the following motives for exploration does de las Casas seem to be criticizing in Source 2?\nOptions:\nConverting the natives to Christianity\nFinancial gain\nPersonal glory\nFinding new mates\nAnswer:", "options": ["Converting the natives to Christianity", "Financial gain", "Personal glory", "Finding new mates"], "lengths": [9, 4, 2, 5], "losses": [0.21852977573871613, 0.0712805688381195, 1.7067290544509888, 0.7112065553665161], "probs": [0.3338440875714162, 0.3868060045878538, 0.07537493567137904, 0.20397497213067053], "sampled": "B", "ideal": "B", "correct": true}}

It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.\nUntil this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.\nErasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all.\"\nJohan Huizinga, twentieth-century Dutch philosopher, Erasmus and the Age of Reformation, 1924\nThe type of humanism attributed to Erasmus in this passage is most similar to what Southern Renaissance movement?\nOptions:\nNeoplatonism\nAntitrinitarianism\nPietism\nRationalism\nAnswer:", "options": ["Neoplatonism", "Antitrinitarianism", "Pietism", "Rationalism"], "lengths": [5, 6, 2, 3], "losses": [0.13446857035160065, 0.82414311170578, 1.9993433952331543, 1.1061006784439087], "probs": [0.49137157014339333, 0.24654044626734484, 0.07612112173449795, 0.18596686180562674], "sampled": "A", "ideal": "A", "correct": true}}

and particularly of what has been called the \"New Philosophy\" or \"Experimental Philosophy.\" We did by agreements \u2026 meet weekly in London on a certain day, to treat and discourse of such affairs. \u2026 Our business was (precluding matters of theology and state affairs), to discourse and consider of Philosophical Enquiries, and such as related thereunto: as physic, anatomy, geometry, astronomy, navigation, statics, magnetics, chemics, mechanics, and natural experiments; with the state of these studies, as then cultivated at home and abroad.

or again because all the constituent parts of the universe, that is the sun, moon and the planets appear in this form; or because everything strives to attain this form, as appears in the case of drops of water and other fluid bodies if they attempt to define themselves. So no one will doubt that this form belongs to the heavenly bodies. \u2026\nThat the earth is also spherical is therefore beyond question, because it presses from all sides upon its center. Although by reason of the elevations of the mountains and the depressions of the valleys a perfect circle cannot be understood, yet this does not affect the general spherical nature of the earth. \u2026\nAs it has been already shown that the earth has the form of a sphere, we must consider whether a movement also coincides with this form, and what place the earth holds in the universe. \u2026 The great majority of authors of course agree that the earth stands still in the center of the universe, and consider it inconceivable and ridiculous to suppose the opposite. But if the matter is carefully weighed, it will be seen that the question is not yet settled and therefore by no means to be regarded lightly. Every change of place which is observed is due, namely, to a movement of the observed object or of the observer, or to movements of both. \u2026 Now it is from the earth that the revolution of the heavens is observed and it is produced for our eyes. Therefore if the earth undergoes no movement this movement must take place in everything outside of the earth, but in the opposite direction than if everything on the earth moved, and of this kind is the daily revolution. So this appears to affect the whole universe, that is, everything outside the earth with the single exception of the earth itself. If, however, one should admit that this movement was not peculiar to the heavens, but that the earth revolved from west to east, and if this was carefully considered in regard to the apparent rising and setting of the sun, the moon and the stars, it would be discovered that this was the real situation.\"\nNicolas Copernicus, The Revolutions of the Heavenly Bodies, 1543\nThe passage may be used as evidence that Copernicus differed from the traditional, Aristotelian natural philosophers of his day because he suggested that\nOptions:\nthe cosmos is spherical\nthe Earth is spherical\nthe cosmos is geostatic\nthe Earth is not stationary\nAnswer:", "options": ["the cosmos is spherical", "the Earth is spherical", "the cosmos is geostatic", "the Earth is not stationary"], "lengths": [6, 5, 7, 6], "losses": [0.096669040620327, 0.2631188929080963, 0.9887204170227051, 0.37153029441833496], "probs": [0.3315477278674445, 0.28070994792441145, 0.13587296907607668, 0.25186935509891256], "sampled": "A", "ideal": "D", "correct": false}}

or again because all the constituent parts of the universe, that is the sun, moon and the planets appear in this form; or because everything strives to attain this form, as appears in the case of drops of water and other fluid bodies if they attempt to define themselves. So no one will doubt that this form belongs to the heavenly bodies. \u2026\nThat the earth is also spherical is therefore beyond question, because it presses from all sides upon its center. Although by reason of the elevations of the mountains and the depressions of the valleys a perfect circle cannot be understood, yet this does not affect the general spherical nature of the earth. \u2026\nAs it has been already shown that the earth has the form of a sphere, we must consider whether a movement also coincides with this form, and what place the earth holds in the universe. \u2026 The great majority of authors of course agree that the earth stands still in the center of the universe, and consider it inconceivable and ridiculous to suppose the opposite. But if the matter is carefully weighed, it will be seen that the question is not yet settled and therefore by no means to be regarded lightly. Every change of place which is observed is due, namely, to a movement of the observed object or of the observer, or to movements of both. \u2026 Now it is from the earth that the revolution of the heavens is observed and it is produced for our eyes. Therefore if the earth undergoes no movement this movement must take place in everything outside of the earth, but in the opposite direction than if everything on the earth moved, and of this kind is the daily revolution. So this appears to affect the whole universe, that is, everything outside the earth with the single exception of the earth itself. If, however, one should admit that this movement was not peculiar to the heavens, but that the earth revolved from west to east, and if this was carefully considered in regard to the apparent rising and setting of the sun, the moon and the stars, it would be discovered that this was the real situation.\"\nNicolas Copernicus, The Revolutions of the Heavenly Bodies, 1543\nFrom the passage, one could argue that Copernicus was working in\nOptions:\nthe Aristotelian tradition\nthe natural magic tradition\nthe skeptical tradition\nthe Platonic/Pythagorean tradition\nAnswer:", "options": ["the Aristotelian tradition", "the natural magic tradition", "the skeptical tradition", "the Platonic/Pythagorean tradition"], "lengths": [5, 4, 5, 10], "losses": [0.23965831100940704, 0.20894990861415863, 0.8141461610794067, 0.26177287101745605], "probs": [0.2799312205976886, 0.2886608110571997, 0.15759935459438265, 0.273808613721863], "sampled": "B", "ideal": "C", "correct": false}}

at his lever, his couches, his meals, in the gardens of Versailles (the only place where the courtiers in general were allowed to follow him), he used to cast his eyes to right and left; nothing escaped him[;] he saw everybody. If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: \"I do not know him\"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, \"He is a man I never see\"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.\nNo one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.\nHe loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him. Motives of policy had something to do with this; by making expensive habits the fashion, and, for people in a certain position, a necessity, he compelled his courtiers to live beyond their income, and gradually reduced them to depend on his bounty for the means of subsistence.\n\u2014Duke Saint-Simon, Memoirs of Louis XIV and His Court and His Regency, c. 1750\nLouis XIV was aided by many able advisors, but which of the following advisors helped him to reorganize France and make it into a world power?\nOptions:\nJean Martinet, his chief military advisor\nCardinal Mazarin, his regent and foreign policy advisor\nJean Baptiste Colbert, his finance minister\nthe Duke of Burgundy\nAnswer:", "options": ["Jean Martinet, his chief military advisor", "Cardinal Mazarin, his regent and foreign policy advisor", "Jean Baptiste Colbert, his finance minister", "the Duke of Burgundy"], "lengths": [9, 13, 10, 6], "losses": [0.208877831697464, 0.251437783241272, 0.12373936176300049, 0.6396132707595825], "probs": [0.27047263476077044, 0.2592028542619582, 0.2945089513508102, 0.17581555959701026], "sampled": "C", "ideal": "C", "correct": true}}

Yet we may be allowed to doubt whether the union was not a little too speedy and a little too thorough. It is surely carrying unity too far to wipe out all traces of the independent being, for most purposes to wipe out the very name, of such a land as Sicily. It jars on our feelings to find that, while Ireland at least forms part of the royal style of its sovereign, Sicily is no longer even a geographical expression. The island realm of Roger has sunk to be seven provinces of the kingdom on the mainland. And there is another result of Italian unity, a result in which we may rejoice without drawbacks, but which still has somewhat of sadness about it as finally ending that great phase of the history of Europe with which we have throughout been dealing. Never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Italy entered liberated Rome. Of all novelties in European history the greatest was when Rome became the centre of a dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds, the head in short of a local Italian kingdom. \"Rome the capital of Italy\" was a formula which might well gladden our hearts; but it was a formula which formally swept away the \u0153cumenical position, the \u0153cumenical traditions, of Rome&\u2026.\nBut the kingdom of Italy is not an appendage to Rome; Rome is the head of the kingdom. The whole is greater than its part; Rome, by her own free will and by the free will of Italy, has become less than Italy. By becoming the willing head of an Italian kingdom she has formally cast aside her Imperial traditions as they were not cast aside when brute force made her the head of a French department.\"\nEdward A.

at his lever, his couches, his meals, in the gardens of Versailles (the only place where the courtiers in general were allowed to follow him), he used to cast his eyes to right and left; nothing escaped him[;] he saw everybody. If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: \"I do not know him\"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, \"He is a man I never see\"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.\nNo one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.\nHe loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him. Motives of policy had something to do with this; by making expensive habits the fashion, and, for people in a certain position, a necessity, he compelled his courtiers to live beyond their income, and gradually reduced them to depend on his bounty for the means of subsistence.\n\u2014Duke Saint-Simon, Memoirs of Louis XIV and His Court and His Regency, c. 1750\nWhich of the following was the greatest weakness and regret of the rule of King Louis XIV?\nOptions:\nHis domination of the nobility left him without friends and allies.\nHe was so concerned with ceremonies and appearances that he did not rule his country well.\nHe left the administration of his kingdom to professional bureaucrats known as intendants.\nHe was at war for 2/3 of his reign and united the other major powers against him.\nAnswer:", "options": ["His domination of the nobility left him without friends and allies.", "He was so concerned with ceremonies and appearances that he did not rule his country well.", "He left the administration of his kingdom to professional bureaucrats known as intendants.", "He was at war for 2/3 of his reign and united the other major powers against him."], "lengths": [15, 19, 18, 22], "losses": [0.4557262063026428, 0.019477475434541702, 0.31785428524017334, 0.2954803705215454], "probs": [0.20540117031315797, 0.3177337367014595, 0.23576532301127495, 0.24109976994233412], "sampled": "B", "ideal": "D", "correct": false}}

It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.\nUntil this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.\nErasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all.\"\nJohan Huizinga, twentieth-century Dutch philosopher, Erasmus and the Age of Reformation, 1924\nWhat was the primary impact of \"Humanism ceas[ing] to be the exclusive privilege of the few\"?\nOptions:\nThe populous demanded rights from the state.\nPeople could begin to question the Church on a wider scale.\nLatin replaced many of the vulgar languages throughout Europe.\nEuropean literature stagnated due to widespread interest in the writings of antiquity.\nAnswer:", "options": ["The populous demanded rights from the state.", "People could begin to question the Church on a wider scale.", "Latin replaced many of the vulgar languages throughout Europe.", "European literature stagnated due to widespread interest in the writings of antiquity."], "lengths": [9, 12, 11, 21], "losses": [0.30900734663009644, 0.02451653778553009, 0.5656029582023621, 0.17959339916706085], "probs": [0.23579748806538794, 0.3133949273958608, 0.18243204064704915, 0.2683755438603625], "sampled": "B", "ideal": "B", "correct": true}}

It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.\nUntil this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.\nErasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all.\"\nJohan Huizinga, twentieth-century Dutch philosopher, Erasmus and the Age of Reformation, 1924\nHuizinga's apparent support of Erasmus' belief in the \"book of antiquity\" being \"open to all\" is most likely a product of\nOptions:\nthe author's life as a member of twentieth-century Europe, which prized such characteristics\nthe longevity of Erasmus' works\nthe Dutch reverence for the works of Erasmus\nthe typical unflinching support of one philosopher for another philosopher's work\nAnswer:", "options": ["the author's life as a member of twentieth-century Europe, which prized such characteristics", "the longevity of Erasmus' works", "the Dutch reverence for the works of Erasmus", "the typical unflinching support of one philosopher for another philosopher's work"], "lengths": [21, 10, 11, 20], "losses": [0.0557979978621006, 0.11474291980266571, 0.18434791266918182, 0.08817069232463837], "probs": [0.2638331650865021, 0.24873100989926736, 0.23200688272502815, 0.2554289422628191], "sampled": "A", "ideal": "A", "correct": true}}

The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive.

We cannot go on indefinitely, that is, for too long a period, basing the Soviet regime and socialist construction on two different foundations, the foundation of the most large-scale and united socialist industry and the foundation of the most scattered and backward, small commodity economy of the peasants. We must gradually, but systematically and persistently, place our agriculture on a new technical basis, the basis of large-scale production, and bring it up to the level of socialist industry.

A large number still remain, and to each of them it is only possible to dole out the least scrap of bread. We only give bread to those who would otherwise die. The staple dish here consists of mice, which the inhabitants hunt, so desperate are they from hunger. They devour roots which the animals cannot eat; one can, in fact, not put into words the things one sees. . . . This narrative, far from exaggerating, rather understates the horror of the case, for it does not record the hundredth part of the misery in this district. Those who have not witnessed it with their own eyes cannot imagine how great it is. Not a day passes but at least 200 people die of famine in the two provinces. We certify to having ourselves seen herds, not of cattle, but of men and women, wandering about the fields between Rheims and Rh\u00e9tel, turning up the earth like pigs to find a few roots; and as they can only find rotten ones, and not half enough of them, they become so weak that they have not strength left to seek food. The parish priest at Boult, whose letter we enclose, tells us he has buried three of his parishioners who died of hunger. The rest subsisted on chopped straw mixed with earth, of which they composed a food which cannot be called bread. Other persons in the same place lived on the bodies of animals which had died of disease, and which the cur\u00e9, otherwise unable to help his people, allowed them to roast at the presbytery fire.\n\u2014Report of the Estates of Normandy, 1651\nWhich of the following contributed the LEAST to the health and hunger problems faced by the French people in the seventeenth century?\nOptions:\nLow-productivity agricultural practices\nAdverse weather\nLow taxes on the peasants and middle class\nPoor transportation\nAnswer:", "options": ["Low-productivity agricultural practices", "Adverse weather", "Low taxes on the peasants and middle class", "Poor transportation"], "lengths": [7, 3, 11, 4], "losses": [0.16808298230171204, 0.5963132977485657, 0.1561228632926941, 0.36130985617637634], "probs": [0.28669821933142386, 0.1868301371405694, 0.2901477514419821, 0.23632389205700996], "sampled": "C", "ideal": "C", "correct": true}}

In ascribing the salvation of the remnant of the people to the election of grace, Paul clearly testifies, that it is then only known that God saves whom upon which there can be no claim. They who shut the gates to prevent anyone from presuming to approach and taste this doctrine, do no less injury to man than to God; for nothing else will be sufficient to produce in us suitable humility, or to impress us with a due sense of our great obligations to God.

The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive.

Yet we may be allowed to doubt whether the union was not a little too speedy and a little too thorough. It is surely carrying unity too far to wipe out all traces of the independent being, for most purposes to wipe out the very name, of such a land as Sicily. It jars on our feelings to find that, while Ireland at least forms part of the royal style of its sovereign, Sicily is no longer even a geographical expression. The island realm of Roger has sunk to be seven provinces of the kingdom on the mainland. And there is another result of Italian unity, a result in which we may rejoice without drawbacks, but which still has somewhat of sadness about it as finally ending that great phase of the history of Europe with which we have throughout been dealing. Never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Italy entered liberated Rome. Of all novelties in European history the greatest was when Rome became the centre of a dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds, the head in short of a local Italian kingdom. \"Rome the capital of Italy\" was a formula which might well gladden our hearts; but it was a formula which formally swept away the \u0153cumenical position, the \u0153cumenical traditions, of Rome&\u2026.\nBut the kingdom of Italy is not an appendage to Rome; Rome is the head of the kingdom. The whole is greater than its part; Rome, by her own free will and by the free will of Italy, has become less than Italy. By becoming the willing head of an Italian kingdom she has formally cast aside her Imperial traditions as they were not cast aside when brute force made her the head of a French department.\"\nEdward A.

Yet we may be allowed to doubt whether the union was not a little too speedy and a little too thorough. It is surely carrying unity too far to wipe out all traces of the independent being, for most purposes to wipe out the very name, of such a land as Sicily. It jars on our feelings to find that, while Ireland at least forms part of the royal style of its sovereign, Sicily is no longer even a geographical expression. The island realm of Roger has sunk to be seven provinces of the kingdom on the mainland. And there is another result of Italian unity, a result in which we may rejoice without drawbacks, but which still has somewhat of sadness about it as finally ending that great phase of the history of Europe with which we have throughout been dealing. Never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Italy entered liberated Rome. Of all novelties in European history the greatest was when Rome became the centre of a dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds, the head in short of a local Italian kingdom. \"Rome the capital of Italy\" was a formula which might well gladden our hearts; but it was a formula which formally swept away the \u0153cumenical position, the \u0153cumenical traditions, of Rome&\u2026.\nBut the kingdom of Italy is not an appendage to Rome; Rome is the head of the kingdom. The whole is greater than its part; Rome, by her own free will and by the free will of Italy, has become less than Italy. By becoming the willing head of an Italian kingdom she has formally cast aside her Imperial traditions as they were not cast aside when brute force made her the head of a French department.\"\nEdward A.

Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nOptions:\nThe ideas of personal liberty and nationalism conceived during the Enlightenment resulted in radical revolutions that could spread throughout Europe.\nThe conquest of Europe by Napoleon led to the creation of new factions and shifted the European balance of power.\nThe power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur.\nThe rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nAnswer: The ideas of personal liberty and nationalism conceived during the Enlightenment resulted in radical revolutions that could spread throughout Europe.\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?\nOptions:\nCapitalist\nScientific\nCommunist\nExistentialist\nAnswer: Communist\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nThe excerpts below are from the Navigation Acts of 1651.\n[A]fter the first day of December, one thousand six hundred fifty and one, and from thence forwards, no goods or commodities whatsoever of the growth, production or manufacture of Asia, Africa or America, or of any part thereof;
