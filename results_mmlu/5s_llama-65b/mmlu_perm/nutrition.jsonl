The tea drinkers have higher risk of developing diabetes.\nC. Based on the information given we cannot tell if the observed difference in disease risk is the result of chance.\nD.

One example is serum methylmalonic acid as a biochemical functional index for vitamin B12 status. What is the primary aim of such biochemical functional index measurements?\nOptions:\nA. To achieve a better estimate of the dietary intake of the micronutrient.\nB. To overcome interference, eg by acute phase-linked effects.\nC. To correct for nutrient losses, e.g. through urinary excretion.\nD. To provide an additional status estimate that can probe critical tissue adequacy, and hence the risk of consequent clinical disease or physiological malfunction.\nAnswer:", "options": ["To achieve a better estimate of the dietary intake of the micronutrient.", "To overcome interference, eg by acute phase-linked effects.", "To correct for nutrient losses, e.g. through urinary excretion.", "To provide an additional status estimate that can probe critical tissue adequacy, and hence the risk of consequent clinical disease or physiological malfunction."], "probs": [[0.017393609508872032, 0.015345342457294464, 0.017387066036462784, 0.9498739242553711], [0.019534924998879433, 0.02213597297668457, 0.9410895109176636, 0.017239511013031006], [0.019472654908895493, 0.01717924140393734, 0.024993373081088066, 0.9383547306060791], [0.02205672115087509, 0.015159347094595432, 0.9377903342247009, 0.024993538856506348], [0.02149912342429161, 0.913983166217804, 0.04015761986374855, 0.024359971284866333], [0.02116376906633377, 0.8997747302055359, 0.03953070938587189, 0.03953070938587189], [0.017425427213311195, 0.013567452318966389, 0.017420955002307892, 0.9515861868858337], [0.019668033346533775, 0.01735549606382847, 0.9476589560508728, 0.015317480079829693], [0.01965191960334778, 0.013505245558917522, 0.019648229703307152, 0.947194516658783], [0.02505633793771267, 0.01519743725657463, 0.9402322173118591, 0.019513897597789764], [0.03439495339989662, 0.8870575428009033, 0.044158633798360825, 0.03438888490200043], [0.034574348479509354, 0.8916842341423035, 0.03917311877012253, 0.03456824645400047], [0.019468292593955994, 0.0171772763133049, 0.024990513920783997, 0.9383639097213745], [0.019535155966877937, 0.01723814569413662, 0.9410905241966248, 0.022136233747005463], [0.015347274020314217, 0.015341129153966904, 0.019698400050401688, 0.949613094329834], [0.019586613401770592, 0.019582699984312057, 0.9435473084449768, 0.017283344641327858], [0.016788039356470108, 0.9163272380828857, 0.03552763909101486, 0.03135707974433899], [0.018958743661642075, 0.913341224193573, 0.04012138769030571, 0.027578560635447502], [0.9131646752357483, 0.031248988583683968, 0.031251344829797745, 0.024335013702511787], [0.9135534763336182, 0.027593176811933517, 0.027590962126851082, 0.031262293457984924], [0.9131642580032349, 0.03125162795186043, 0.031249118968844414, 0.024335002526640892], [0.9031747579574585, 0.0350198820233345, 0.030904939398169518, 0.030900418758392334], [0.9027326703071594, 0.027264151722192764, 0.03500274568796158, 0.03500041365623474], [0.9064564108848572, 0.031019430607557297, 0.03514961898326874, 0.027374552562832832]], "ideal": "D"}}
