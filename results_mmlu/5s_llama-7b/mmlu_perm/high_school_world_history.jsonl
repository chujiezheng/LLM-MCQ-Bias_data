By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility.

One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . . He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. . . . On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals. . . . The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value. Beyond this country lies another called Malal, the king of which was sincerely attached to Islam, while the common people of his kingdom remained polytheists. Since then their rulers have been given the title of al-musulmani .\n\u2014The Book of Routes and Realms , by Abu Ubaydallah al-Bakri, eleventh-century Muslim historian and geographer\nWhat evidence is there in the passage that Ghanians were engaged, directly or indirectly, in trade with Asia?\nOptions:\nA.

He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them. . . . He decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.\n\u2014Adapted from U.S. Army Lt.

Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nAccording to the second passage, the Cawnpore Massacre\nOptions:\nA. was justifiable according to local military custom, even if it violated Western military norms.\nB. can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.\nC. should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression.\nD. seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy.\nAnswer:", "options": ["was justifiable according to local military custom, even if it violated Western military norms.", "can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.", "should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression.", "seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy."], "probs": [[0.3075617253780365, 0.3275257349014282, 0.17536361515522003, 0.18954892456531525], [0.32032841444015503, 0.32550254464149475, 0.18264782428741455, 0.17152123153209686], [0.2523765563964844, 0.26876798272132874, 0.25254586338996887, 0.2263096123933792], [0.2372855842113495, 0.26483964920043945, 0.24119915068149567, 0.2566755712032318], [0.2960755527019501, 0.2870805561542511, 0.2343721091747284, 0.18247176706790924], [0.2665949761867523, 0.2839263677597046, 0.21775612235069275, 0.23172248899936676], [0.3491213619709015, 0.26778358221054077, 0.18410231173038483, 0.19899272918701172], [0.36260971426963806, 0.26957032084465027, 0.18825244903564453, 0.17956744134426117], [0.34070464968681335, 0.26132869720458984, 0.19124871492385864, 0.20671798288822174], [0.34500089287757874, 0.2646160125732422, 0.19979950785636902, 0.19058358669281006], [0.3735378086566925, 0.27338606119155884, 0.17656733095645905, 0.1765087991952896], [0.3605826497077942, 0.2765686511993408, 0.17862065136432648, 0.18422801792621613], [0.23472346365451813, 0.2832525968551636, 0.25796645879745483, 0.2240573912858963], [0.23056544363498688, 0.27825668454170227, 0.24563264846801758, 0.24554529786109924], [0.2645338773727417, 0.3451531231403351, 0.19366267323493958, 0.19665032625198364], [0.2698173224925995, 0.3465893268585205, 0.20380045473575592, 0.1797928363084793], [0.23286904394626617, 0.2899453043937683, 0.23303821682929993, 0.2441474199295044], [0.24021723866462708, 0.3037775456905365, 0.2598858177661896, 0.19611941277980804], [0.27778422832489014, 0.28671810030937195, 0.24150504171848297, 0.19399255514144897], [0.253861665725708, 0.2833442986011505, 0.22420786321163177, 0.23858611285686493], [0.3084695041179657, 0.3284907639026642, 0.187217578291893, 0.1758221983909607], [0.30016955733299255, 0.32979562878608704, 0.18504643440246582, 0.1849883496761322], [0.24110691249370575, 0.26083245873451233, 0.24129046499729156, 0.25677022337913513], [0.24984553456306458, 0.2702596187591553, 0.26612356305122375, 0.2137712985277176]], "ideal": "B"}}

He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them. . . . He decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.\n\u2014Adapted from U.S. Army Lt.

An increase in social unrest\nAnswer: B\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together. We maintain that this is the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.\"\nMao Zedong, On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation, 1955\nWhich of the following best explains Mao's concept of the \"socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture\" in China?\nOptions:\nA.

The law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction. The result was an important new stage in international contact. From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries. Secure trade routes made for prosperous merchants and wealthy, cosmopolitan cities. They also facilitated the spread of foods [and] inventions . . . a major force for economic and social development and the enhancement of civilized life.\n\u2014Robert Guisepi, 1992\nThe Mongol empire used which of the following to integrate its vast, geographically diverse area?\nOptions:\nA.

He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them. . . . He decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.\n\u2014Adapted from U.S. Army Lt.

Isn't negotiation a better path?\" You are quite right in calling, for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent-resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word \"tension.\" I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, we must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.\"\nMartin Luther King, Jr., Letter from a Birmingham Jail, 1966\nSource 2:\n\"We, men and women, who hereby constitute ourselves as the National Organization for Women, believe that the time has come for a new movement toward true equality for all women in America, and toward a fully equal partnership of the sexes, as part of the world-wide revolution of human rights now taking place within and beyond our national borders.\nThe purpose of NOW is to take action to bring women into full participation in the mainstream of American society now, exercising all the privileges and responsibilities thereof in truly equal partnership with men.\nWe believe the time has come to move beyond the abstract argument, discussion and symposia over the status and special nature of women which has raged in America in recent years; the time has come to confront, with concrete action, the conditions that now prevent women from enjoying the equality of opportunity and freedom of which is their right, as individual Americans, and as human beings.\"\nNational Organization for Women, Statement of Purpose, 1966\nSource 3:\n\"The long-term goal of Gay Liberation, which inevitably brings us into conflict with the institutionalized sexism of this society, is to rid society of the gender-role system which is at the root of our oppression. This can only be achieved by eliminating the social pressures on men and women to conform to narrowly defined gender roles. It is particularly important that children and young people be encouraged to develop their own talents and interests and to express their own individuality rather than act out stereotyped parts alien to their nature.\nAs we cannot carry out this revolutionary change alone, and as the abolition of gender rotes is also a necessary condition of women's liberation, we will work to form a strategic alliance with the women's liberation movement, aiming to develop our ideas and our practice in close inter-relation.

Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system.

Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nIn the short term, the events discussed in both passages led to which of the following outcomes?\nOptions:\nA.

The Bahr [al-Fava'id, or \"Sea of Precious Virtues,\" written in the 1150s or 1160s] insists that the first duty of a Muslim ruler is to prosecute the jihad and bring about the victory of Islam, and if he does not do so and he makes peace with the infidel, that ruler would be better dead than alive, for he would be corrupting the world.\nRobert Irwin, \"Islam and the Crusades,\" 1995\nIt is strange how the Christians round Mount Lebanon, when they see any Muslim hermits, bring them food and treat them kindly, saying that these men are dedicated to the Great and Glorious God and that they should therefore share with them.

On whom therefore is the labor of avenging these wrongs and of recovering this territory incumbent, if not upon you? You, upon whom above other nations God has conferred remarkable glory in arms, great courage, bodily activity, and strength to humble the hairy scalp of those who resist you.\nLet the deeds of your ancestors move you and incite your minds to manly achievements; the glory and greatness of king Charles the Great, and of his son Louis, and of your other kings, who have destroyed the kingdoms of the pagans, and extended in these lands the territory of the holy church. Let the holy sepulchre of the Lord our Savior, which is possessed by unclean nations, especially incite you, and the holy places which are now treated with ignominy and irreverently polluted with their filthiness. Oh, most valiant soldiers and descendants of invincible ancestors, be not degenerate, but recall the valor of your progenitors.\nJerusalem is the navel of the world; the land is fruitful above others, like another paradise of delights. This the Redeemer of the human race has made illustrious by His advent, has beautified by residence, has consecrated by suffering, has redeemed by death, has glorified by burial. This royal city, therefore, situated at the center of the world, is now held captive by His enemies, and is in subjection to those who do not know God, to the worship of the heathens. She seeks therefore and desires to be liberated and does not cease to implore you to come to her aid. From you especially she asks succor, because, as we have already said, God has conferred upon you above all nations great glory in arms.

Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nThe passages above can best be connected with which of the following forms of violence?\nOptions:\nA.

They assume authority, and juggle before us with impudent words, saying that the Pope cannot err in matters of faith, whether he be evil or good, albeit they cannot prove it by a single letter. That is why the canon law contains so many heretical and unchristian, nay unnatural, laws; but of these we need not speak now. For whereas they imagine the Holy Ghost never leaves them, however unlearned and wicked they may be, they grow bold enough to decree whatever they like. But were this true, where were the need and use of the Holy Scriptures? Let us burn them, and content ourselves with the unlearned gentlemen at Rome, in whom the Holy Ghost dwells, who, however, can dwell in pious souls only. If I had not read it, I could never have believed that the devil should have put forth such follies at Rome and find a following.\"\nMartin Luther, Address to the Nobility of the German Nation, 1520\nWhen the author of the passage above discusses the \"second wall,\" to what is he referring?\nOptions:\nA.

Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potos\u00ed have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.\nAntonio Vasquez de Espinosa, report on mining in Huanacavelica and Potos\u00ed, 1620s\nThe third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute. Some have paid in sables, others in red foxes, still others in cash. At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands, from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River. Moreover, almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors.\nHeinrich von F\u00fcch, \"On the Treatment of Natives in Northeast Siberia,\" 1744\nAccording to the second passage, which of the following contributed most to the burden faced by native Siberians attempting to fulfill their tribute obligations?\nOptions:\nA.

But we do not want to be beaten. No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her\u2013\u2013because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: \"You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia.\" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: \"You are abundant,\" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: \"You are poor and impotent,\" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters\u2013\u2013to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism. You are backward, you are weak\u2013\u2013therefore you are wrong; hence you can be beaten and enslaved. You are mighty\u2013\u2013therefore you are right; hence we must be wary of you.\nThat is why we must no longer lag behind.\"\nJoseph Stalin, speech delivered at the first All-Union Conference of Leading Personnel of Socialist Industry, February 4, 1931\nThe speech as a whole is best understood in the context of which of the following historical developments?\nOptions:\nA.

An increase in social unrest\nAnswer: B\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together. We maintain that this is the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.\"\nMao Zedong, On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation, 1955\nWhich of the following later developments would most undermine the hopes expressed by Mao in the second-to-last line of the passage?\nOptions:\nA.

By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nAccording to this passage, why did the Chinese, despite inventing gunpowder, fail to lead in the innovation of gunpowder weaponry?\nOptions:\nA.

The law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction. The result was an important new stage in international contact. From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries. Secure trade routes made for prosperous merchants and wealthy, cosmopolitan cities. They also facilitated the spread of foods [and] inventions . . . a major force for economic and social development and the enhancement of civilized life.\n\u2014Robert Guisepi, 1992\nWhich of the following was a long-term consequence of the Mongol conquest of Russia in the 1200s?\nOptions:\nA.

On whom therefore is the labor of avenging these wrongs and of recovering this territory incumbent, if not upon you? You, upon whom above other nations God has conferred remarkable glory in arms, great courage, bodily activity, and strength to humble the hairy scalp of those who resist you.\nLet the deeds of your ancestors move you and incite your minds to manly achievements; the glory and greatness of king Charles the Great, and of his son Louis, and of your other kings, who have destroyed the kingdoms of the pagans, and extended in these lands the territory of the holy church. Let the holy sepulchre of the Lord our Savior, which is possessed by unclean nations, especially incite you, and the holy places which are now treated with ignominy and irreverently polluted with their filthiness. Oh, most valiant soldiers and descendants of invincible ancestors, be not degenerate, but recall the valor of your progenitors.\nJerusalem is the navel of the world; the land is fruitful above others, like another paradise of delights. This the Redeemer of the human race has made illustrious by His advent, has beautified by residence, has consecrated by suffering, has redeemed by death, has glorified by burial. This royal city, therefore, situated at the center of the world, is now held captive by His enemies, and is in subjection to those who do not know God, to the worship of the heathens. She seeks therefore and desires to be liberated and does not cease to implore you to come to her aid. From you especially she asks succor, because, as we have already said, God has conferred upon you above all nations great glory in arms.

It is not out of mere arrogance and perversity that I, an individual poor man, have taken upon me to address your lordships. The distress and misery that oppress all the Christian estates, more especially in Germany, have led not only myself, but every one else, to cry aloud and to ask for help. . . . These Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls around themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly. . . . That the Temporal Power Has no Jurisdiction over the Spirituality . . . That No One May Interpret the Scriptures but the Pope . . . That No One May Call a Council but the Pope. . . . Let us now consider the matters which should be treated in the councils, and with which popes, cardinals, bishops, and all learned men should occupy themselves day and night. . . . It is a distressing and terrible thing to see that the head of Christendom, who boasts of being the vicar of Christ and the successor of St. Peter, lives in a worldly pomp that no king or emperor can equal. What is the use in Christendom of the people called \"cardinals\"? I will tell you. In Italy and Germany there are many rich convents, endowments, fiefs, and benefices, and as the best way of getting these into the hands of Rome, they created cardinals, and gave them the sees, convents, and prelacies, and thus destroyed the service of God.\n\u2014Martin Luther, Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation\nWhich of the following reformers expressed views similar to those expressed by Martin Luther in his letter above?\nOptions:\nA.

They assume authority, and juggle before us with impudent words, saying that the Pope cannot err in matters of faith, whether he be evil or good, albeit they cannot prove it by a single letter. That is why the canon law contains so many heretical and unchristian, nay unnatural, laws; but of these we need not speak now. For whereas they imagine the Holy Ghost never leaves them, however unlearned and wicked they may be, they grow bold enough to decree whatever they like. But were this true, where were the need and use of the Holy Scriptures? Let us burn them, and content ourselves with the unlearned gentlemen at Rome, in whom the Holy Ghost dwells, who, however, can dwell in pious souls only. If I had not read it, I could never have believed that the devil should have put forth such follies at Rome and find a following.\"\nMartin Luther, Address to the Nobility of the German Nation, 1520\nHow is the \"temporal power\" mentioned in the passage best understood contextually?\nOptions:\nA.

An increase in social unrest\nAnswer: B\n\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together. We maintain that this is the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.\"\nMao Zedong, On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation, 1955\nMao's quotation is best understood in the context of which of the following?\nOptions:\nA.

And none of them derives his genealogy from his father but, on the contrary, from his maternal uncle. A man does not pass on inheritance except to the sons of his sister to the exclusion of his own sons. . . . They are Muslims keeping to the prayers, studying fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and learning the Qur'an by heart. With regard to their women, they are not modest in the presence of men; they do not veil themselves in spite of their perseverance in the prayers. He who wishes to marry among them can marry, but the women do not travel with the husband, and if one of them wanted to do that, she would be prevented by her family. The women there have friends and companions amongst men outside the prohibited degrees of marriage [i.e., other than brothers, fathers, etc.]. Likewise for the men, there are companions from amongst women outside the prohibited degrees. One of them would enter his house to find his wife with her companion and would not disapprove of that conduct.\n\u2014Adapted from an account by Ibn Battuta of his travels in Mali during the 1300s\nWhat evidence is there in the passage that the Malians take their Muslim faith seriously?\nOptions:\nA.

On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together. We maintain that this is the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.\"\nMao Zedong, On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation, 1955\nMao's view of the cooperation of peasant labor most directly reflects the influence of which of the following?\nOptions:\nA.

It is not out of mere arrogance and perversity that I, an individual poor man, have taken upon me to address your lordships. The distress and misery that oppress all the Christian estates, more especially in Germany, have led not only myself, but every one else, to cry aloud and to ask for help. . . . These Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls around themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly. . . . That the Temporal Power Has no Jurisdiction over the Spirituality . . . That No One May Interpret the Scriptures but the Pope . . . That No One May Call a Council but the Pope. . . . Let us now consider the matters which should be treated in the councils, and with which popes, cardinals, bishops, and all learned men should occupy themselves day and night. . . . It is a distressing and terrible thing to see that the head of Christendom, who boasts of being the vicar of Christ and the successor of St. Peter, lives in a worldly pomp that no king or emperor can equal. What is the use in Christendom of the people called \"cardinals\"? I will tell you. In Italy and Germany there are many rich convents, endowments, fiefs, and benefices, and as the best way of getting these into the hands of Rome, they created cardinals, and gave them the sees, convents, and prelacies, and thus destroyed the service of God.\n\u2014Martin Luther, Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation\nIn his letter, Martin Luther avoided speaking about which of the following topics?\nOptions:\nA.

The same is true in all the other mines: the silver mines of Potosi [and others]\u2026.The owners and stewards of the mines, whether Spaniards, mestizos, or Indians, are such tyrants, with no fear of God or Justice, because they are not audited and are not inspected twice a year\u2026.\nAnd they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines. The Indians, under the pretext of mining chores, are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains, and the Indians die. These Indians are not paid for their labor, and their work is kept hidden.\nAnd [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubines\u2026.And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]\u2026at their own expense, and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays. In this way, the Indians end up very poor and deep in debt, and they have no way to pay their tribute.\nThere is no remedy for all this, because any [colonial official] who enters comes to an agreement with the mine owners, and all the owners join forces in bribing him\u2026.Even the protector of the Indians is useless;\u2026he [does not] warn Your Majesty or your royal Audiencia [court] about the harms done to the poor Indians.\"\nExcerpt from The First New Chronicle and Good Government [abridged], by Felipe Guaman Poma de Alaya.

Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potos\u00ed have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.\nAntonio Vasquez de Espinosa, report on mining in Huanacavelica and Potos\u00ed, 1620s\nThe third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute. Some have paid in sables, others in red foxes, still others in cash. At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands, from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River. Moreover, almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors.\nHeinrich von F\u00fcch, \"On the Treatment of Natives in Northeast Siberia,\" 1744\nBoth passages are best seen in the context of which of the following broad developments?\nOptions:\nA.

Isn't negotiation a better path?\" You are quite right in calling, for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent-resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word \"tension.\" I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, we must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.\"\nMartin Luther King, Jr., Letter from a Birmingham Jail, 1966\nSource 2:\n\"We, men and women, who hereby constitute ourselves as the National Organization for Women, believe that the time has come for a new movement toward true equality for all women in America, and toward a fully equal partnership of the sexes, as part of the world-wide revolution of human rights now taking place within and beyond our national borders.\nThe purpose of NOW is to take action to bring women into full participation in the mainstream of American society now, exercising all the privileges and responsibilities thereof in truly equal partnership with men.\nWe believe the time has come to move beyond the abstract argument, discussion and symposia over the status and special nature of women which has raged in America in recent years; the time has come to confront, with concrete action, the conditions that now prevent women from enjoying the equality of opportunity and freedom of which is their right, as individual Americans, and as human beings.\"\nNational Organization for Women, Statement of Purpose, 1966\nSource 3:\n\"The long-term goal of Gay Liberation, which inevitably brings us into conflict with the institutionalized sexism of this society, is to rid society of the gender-role system which is at the root of our oppression. This can only be achieved by eliminating the social pressures on men and women to conform to narrowly defined gender roles. It is particularly important that children and young people be encouraged to develop their own talents and interests and to express their own individuality rather than act out stereotyped parts alien to their nature.\nAs we cannot carry out this revolutionary change alone, and as the abolition of gender rotes is also a necessary condition of women's liberation, we will work to form a strategic alliance with the women's liberation movement, aiming to develop our ideas and our practice in close inter-relation.

The law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction. The result was an important new stage in international contact. From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries. Secure trade routes made for prosperous merchants and wealthy, cosmopolitan cities. They also facilitated the spread of foods [and] inventions . . . a major force for economic and social development and the enhancement of civilized life.\n\u2014Robert Guisepi, 1992\nWhich statement most accurately compares the Mongol (post-classical) empire with the Persian (classical) empire?\nOptions:\nA.

To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil.

When the gods performed a sacrifice with the offering Purusa, spring was its clarified butter, summer the kindling, autumn the oblation.\nIt was Purusa, born in the beginning, which they sprinkled on the sacred grass as a sacrifice. It made the beasts of the air, the forest and the village. From that sacrifice completely offered, the mantras [Rig Veda] and the songs [Samaveda] were born. The sacrificial formulae [Yajurveda] were born from it. From it the horses were born and all that have cutting teeth in both jaws. The cows were born from it, also. From it were born goats and sheep.\nWhen they divided Purusa, how many ways did they apportion him? What was his mouth? What were his arms? What were his thighs, his feet declared to be? His mouth was the Brahman, his arms were the Rajanaya [Ksatriya], his thighs the Vaisya; from his feet the Sudra was born. Thus, they fashioned the worlds.

The soldiery divided themselves into two companies . . . with orders to attack places without defenses and to carry off the inhabitants as well as seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields. . . . Whilst waiting for the return of the companies despatched to hunt Negroes, we went every day to the slave market where we bought at the following prices:\nA Negro with beard\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u202610 or 15,000 cowries.\nThey are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.\nAn adult Negress\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..10 or 15,000 cowries for the same reasons\nAn adolescent Negro\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.30,000 cowries\nA young Negress \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u202650\u201360,000 cowries\nThe price varies according to whether she is more or less beautiful.\nA male Negro child\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..45,000 cowries\nA female Negro child \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.35\u201340,000 cowries\nFinally, our caravan which had set out from Algeria with sixty-four camels and only sixteen persons, was now augmented by four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women. . . . It was at this point that suddenly a confused noise of cries and sobs passed from one group of slaves to another and reached our own. . . . Some rolled on the ground, clung to bushes and absolutely refused to walk. . . . They could only be got up with mighty lashes of the whip and by rendering them completely bloody.\nWhich statement best supports the argument that religion played a role in the Arab slave trade?\nOptions:\nA.

To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.\nWilliam Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, \"On the Suppression of Sati,\" 1829\nI have made it my study to examine the nature and character of the Indians [who trade with us], and however repugnant it may be to our feelings, I am convinced they must be ruled with a rod of iron, to bring and keep them in a proper state of subordination, and the most certain way to effect this is by letting them feel their dependence on [the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them].\nGeorge Simpson, Head of Northern Department, Hudson's Bay Company, 1826\nThe first passage can be said to undermine which commonly held assumption about Western imperialism?\nOptions:\nA.

But we do not want to be beaten. No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her\u2013\u2013because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: \"You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia.\" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: \"You are abundant,\" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: \"You are poor and impotent,\" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters\u2013\u2013to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism. You are backward, you are weak\u2013\u2013therefore you are wrong; hence you can be beaten and enslaved. You are mighty\u2013\u2013therefore you are right; hence we must be wary of you.\nThat is why we must no longer lag behind.\"\nJoseph Stalin, speech delivered at the first All-Union Conference of Leading Personnel of Socialist Industry, February 4, 1931\nStalin's speech is most strongly influenced by which of the following?\nOptions:\nA.

On whom therefore is the labor of avenging these wrongs and of recovering this territory incumbent, if not upon you? You, upon whom above other nations God has conferred remarkable glory in arms, great courage, bodily activity, and strength to humble the hairy scalp of those who resist you.\nLet the deeds of your ancestors move you and incite your minds to manly achievements; the glory and greatness of king Charles the Great, and of his son Louis, and of your other kings, who have destroyed the kingdoms of the pagans, and extended in these lands the territory of the holy church. Let the holy sepulchre of the Lord our Savior, which is possessed by unclean nations, especially incite you, and the holy places which are now treated with ignominy and irreverently polluted with their filthiness. Oh, most valiant soldiers and descendants of invincible ancestors, be not degenerate, but recall the valor of your progenitors.\nJerusalem is the navel of the world; the land is fruitful above others, like another paradise of delights. This the Redeemer of the human race has made illustrious by His advent, has beautified by residence, has consecrated by suffering, has redeemed by death, has glorified by burial. This royal city, therefore, situated at the center of the world, is now held captive by His enemies, and is in subjection to those who do not know God, to the worship of the heathens. She seeks therefore and desires to be liberated and does not cease to implore you to come to her aid. From you especially she asks succor, because, as we have already said, God has conferred upon you above all nations great glory in arms.

Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple.

It may be answered that one should wish to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with. Because this is to be asserted in general of men, that they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as you succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood, property, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far distant; but when it approaches they turn against you. And that prince who, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other precautions, is ruined; because friendships that are obtained by payments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed be earned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied upon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails.\"\nNicolo Machiavelli, The Prince, ca. 1513 C.E.\nThe political philosophy espoused in the text above is different from those of the medieval period in which of the following ways?\nOptions:\nA.

When the gods performed a sacrifice with the offering Purusa, spring was its clarified butter, summer the kindling, autumn the oblation.\nIt was Purusa, born in the beginning, which they sprinkled on the sacred grass as a sacrifice. It made the beasts of the air, the forest and the village. From that sacrifice completely offered, the mantras [Rig Veda] and the songs [Samaveda] were born. The sacrificial formulae [Yajurveda] were born from it. From it the horses were born and all that have cutting teeth in both jaws. The cows were born from it, also. From it were born goats and sheep.\nWhen they divided Purusa, how many ways did they apportion him? What was his mouth? What were his arms? What were his thighs, his feet declared to be? His mouth was the Brahman, his arms were the Rajanaya [Ksatriya], his thighs the Vaisya; from his feet the Sudra was born. Thus, they fashioned the worlds.

And none of them derives his genealogy from his father but, on the contrary, from his maternal uncle. A man does not pass on inheritance except to the sons of his sister to the exclusion of his own sons. . . . They are Muslims keeping to the prayers, studying fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and learning the Qur'an by heart. With regard to their women, they are not modest in the presence of men; they do not veil themselves in spite of their perseverance in the prayers. He who wishes to marry among them can marry, but the women do not travel with the husband, and if one of them wanted to do that, she would be prevented by her family. The women there have friends and companions amongst men outside the prohibited degrees of marriage [i.e., other than brothers, fathers, etc.]. Likewise for the men, there are companions from amongst women outside the prohibited degrees. One of them would enter his house to find his wife with her companion and would not disapprove of that conduct.\n\u2014Adapted from an account by Ibn Battuta of his travels in Mali during the 1300s\nWhat was the likely cause of women not wearing the veil?\nOptions:\nA.

The place and date of trial is unknown.\nThe Begum Saheba and Mr. Hayat were permitted to see him after arrest.\nHe and I were going to address a meeting outside the station. He was arrested. I continued going to the meeting and addressed them. There is no cause for sorrow, but every cause for congratulation. There should be no hartal. Perfect peace and calmness should be observed. I regard the arrest as a prelude to Swaraj and the redress of the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs, if we can remain non-violent. Retain Hindu-Muslim Unity despite the madness of some Moplahs, and fulfil the Swadeshi programme.\nI hope every Indian, man or woman, will completely boycott foreign cloth and take up spinning or weaving during every spare minute.\nBy striving like the Maulana, be insistent on religious and national rights.\nLet us earn imprisonment.

Americans by birth and Europeans by law, we find ourselves engaged in a dual conflict: we are disputing with the natives for titles of ownership, and at the same time we are struggling to maintain ourselves in the country that gave us birth against the opposition of the invaders. Thus our position is most extraordinary and complicated. But there is more. As our role has always been strictly passive and political existence nil, we find that our quest for liberty is now even more difficult of accomplishment; for we, having been placed in a state lower than slavery, had been robbed not only of our freedom but also of the right to exercise an active domestic tyranny\u2026We have been ruled more by deceit than by force, and we have been degraded more by vice than by superstition. Slavery is the daughter of darkness: an ignorant people is a blind instrument of its own destruction. Ambition and intrigue abuses the credulity and experience of men lacking all political, economic, and civic knowledge; they adopt pure illusion as reality; they take license for liberty, treachery for patriotism, and vengeance for justice. If a people, perverted by their training, succeed in achieving their liberty, they will soon lose it, for it would be of no avail to endeavor to explain to them that happiness consists in the practice of virtue; that the rule of law is more powerful than the rule of tyrants, because, as the laws are more inflexible, every one should submit to their beneficent austerity; that proper morals, and not force, are the bases of law; and that to practice justice is to practice liberty.\"\nSim\u00f3n de Bol\u00edvar, Message to the Congress of Angostura, 1819\nThe passage is best understood in the context of which of the following political movements?\nOptions:\nA.

When they drew nigh to his person, they paid their respects by prostrating themselves on the floor. He immediately commanded them to rise, and to relate to him the circumstances of their travels, with all that had taken place in their negotiation with his holiness the pope. To their narrative, which they gave in the regular order of events, and delivered in perspicuous language, he listened with attentive silence. The letters and the presents from pope Gregory were then laid before him, and, upon hearing the former read, he bestowed much commendation on the fidelity, the zeal, and the diligence of his ambassadors; and receiving with due reverence the oil from the holy sepulchre, he gave directions that it should be preserved with religious care. Upon his observing Marco Polo, and inquiring who he was, Nicolo made answer, This is your servant, and my son; upon which the grand Khan replied, \"He is welcome, and it pleases me much,\" and he caused him to be enrolled amongst his attendants of honor. And on account of their return he made a great feast and rejoicing; and as long as the said brothers and Marco remained in the court of the grand Khan, they were honored even above his own courtiers. Marco was held in high estimation and respect by all belonging to the court. He learnt in a short time and adopted the manners of the Tartars, and acquired a proficiency in four different languages, which he became qualified to read and write.\"\nMarco Polo's Travels, ca. 1300 C.E.\nThe encounter described in the account above illustrates which of the following?\nOptions:\nA.

Americans by birth and Europeans by law, we find ourselves engaged in a dual conflict: we are disputing with the natives for titles of ownership, and at the same time we are struggling to maintain ourselves in the country that gave us birth against the opposition of the invaders. Thus our position is most extraordinary and complicated. But there is more. As our role has always been strictly passive and political existence nil, we find that our quest for liberty is now even more difficult of accomplishment; for we, having been placed in a state lower than slavery, had been robbed not only of our freedom but also of the right to exercise an active domestic tyranny\u2026We have been ruled more by deceit than by force, and we have been degraded more by vice than by superstition. Slavery is the daughter of darkness: an ignorant people is a blind instrument of its own destruction. Ambition and intrigue abuses the credulity and experience of men lacking all political, economic, and civic knowledge; they adopt pure illusion as reality; they take license for liberty, treachery for patriotism, and vengeance for justice. If a people, perverted by their training, succeed in achieving their liberty, they will soon lose it, for it would be of no avail to endeavor to explain to them that happiness consists in the practice of virtue; that the rule of law is more powerful than the rule of tyrants, because, as the laws are more inflexible, every one should submit to their beneficent austerity; that proper morals, and not force, are the bases of law; and that to practice justice is to practice liberty.\"\nSim\u00f3n de Bol\u00edvar, Message to the Congress of Angostura, 1819\nSim\u00f3n de Bol\u00edvar, the author of the passage, accomplished which of the following?\nOptions:\nA.

The same is true in all the other mines: the silver mines of Potosi [and others]\u2026.The owners and stewards of the mines, whether Spaniards, mestizos, or Indians, are such tyrants, with no fear of God or Justice, because they are not audited and are not inspected twice a year\u2026.\nAnd they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines. The Indians, under the pretext of mining chores, are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains, and the Indians die. These Indians are not paid for their labor, and their work is kept hidden.\nAnd [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubines\u2026.And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]\u2026at their own expense, and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays. In this way, the Indians end up very poor and deep in debt, and they have no way to pay their tribute.\nThere is no remedy for all this, because any [colonial official] who enters comes to an agreement with the mine owners, and all the owners join forces in bribing him\u2026.Even the protector of the Indians is useless;\u2026he [does not] warn Your Majesty or your royal Audiencia [court] about the harms done to the poor Indians.\"\nExcerpt from The First New Chronicle and Good Government [abridged], by Felipe Guaman Poma de Alaya.

He had been a monk from infancy, and ever since birth he had eaten vegetarian food and observed the prohibitions. His maternal grandfather was an imperial commander, Yin Kaishan. His father Chen Guangrui had come top in the Palace Examination and had been appointed a grand secretary in the Imperial Library. Xuanzang, however, had no interest in honour and glory, and his only joy was to cultivate Nirvana. His virtue was great; of the thousand sutras and ten thousand holy books there was not a single one that he did not know.\n\u2026\nHe looked to the West and prayed, \"I am the believer Chen Xuanzang sent on imperial orders to fetch the scriptures. If I am fated to have a disciple, may I be able to unseal the golden words and release the divine Monkey King to come with me to the Vulture Peak. If I am not fated to have a disciple, and this monkey is an evil monster who has deceived me and will do me no good, then may I be unable to remove the seal.\" When he had prayed he bowed again.\nFrom Wu Chengen, Journey to the West, ca. 1590s\nIn which of the following ways does the excerpt above most complicate historians' understanding of the career of the Chinese monk and traveler Xuanzang?\nOptions:\nA.

And none of them derives his genealogy from his father but, on the contrary, from his maternal uncle. A man does not pass on inheritance except to the sons of his sister to the exclusion of his own sons. . . . They are Muslims keeping to the prayers, studying fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and learning the Qur'an by heart. With regard to their women, they are not modest in the presence of men; they do not veil themselves in spite of their perseverance in the prayers. He who wishes to marry among them can marry, but the women do not travel with the husband, and if one of them wanted to do that, she would be prevented by her family.

Americans by birth and Europeans by law, we find ourselves engaged in a dual conflict: we are disputing with the natives for titles of ownership, and at the same time we are struggling to maintain ourselves in the country that gave us birth against the opposition of the invaders. Thus our position is most extraordinary and complicated. But there is more. As our role has always been strictly passive and political existence nil, we find that our quest for liberty is now even more difficult of accomplishment; for we, having been placed in a state lower than slavery, had been robbed not only of our freedom but also of the right to exercise an active domestic tyranny\u2026We have been ruled more by deceit than by force, and we have been degraded more by vice than by superstition. Slavery is the daughter of darkness: an ignorant people is a blind instrument of its own destruction. Ambition and intrigue abuses the credulity and experience of men lacking all political, economic, and civic knowledge; they adopt pure illusion as reality; they take license for liberty, treachery for patriotism, and vengeance for justice. If a people, perverted by their training, succeed in achieving their liberty, they will soon lose it, for it would be of no avail to endeavor to explain to them that happiness consists in the practice of virtue; that the rule of law is more powerful than the rule of tyrants, because, as the laws are more inflexible, every one should submit to their beneficent austerity; that proper morals, and not force, are the bases of law; and that to practice justice is to practice liberty.\"\nSim\u00f3n de Bol\u00edvar, Message to the Congress of Angostura, 1819\nThe author of this text expresses a belief in which of the following as requirements for a properly functioning legal system?\nOptions:\nA.

When the gods performed a sacrifice with the offering Purusa, spring was its clarified butter, summer the kindling, autumn the oblation.\nIt was Purusa, born in the beginning, which they sprinkled on the sacred grass as a sacrifice. It made the beasts of the air, the forest and the village. From that sacrifice completely offered, the mantras [Rig Veda] and the songs [Samaveda] were born. The sacrificial formulae [Yajurveda] were born from it. From it the horses were born and all that have cutting teeth in both jaws. The cows were born from it, also. From it were born goats and sheep.\nWhen they divided Purusa, how many ways did they apportion him? What was his mouth? What were his arms? What were his thighs, his feet declared to be? His mouth was the Brahman, his arms were the Rajanaya [Ksatriya], his thighs the Vaisya; from his feet the Sudra was born. Thus, they fashioned the worlds.

He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them. . . . He decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.\n\u2014Adapted from U.S. Army Lt.

Its administration favors the many instead of the few; this is why it is called a democracy. If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in their private differences; if no social standing, advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit; nor again does poverty bar the way, if a man is able to serve the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition. The freedom which we enjoy in our government extends also to our ordinary life. There, far from exercising a jealous surveillance over each other, we do not feel called upon to be angry with our neighbor for doing what he likes, or even to indulge in those injurious looks which cannot fail to be offensive, although they inflict no positive penalty. But all this ease in our private relations does not make us lawless as citizens. Against this fear is our chief safeguard, teaching us to obey the magistrates and the laws, particularly such as regard the protection of the injured, whether they are actually on the statute book, or belong to that code which, although unwritten, yet cannot be broken without acknowledged disgrace.\"\nThucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, ca. 415 B.C.E.\nDuring the time period in which this text was written, who was allowed to participate in the Greek democratic process?\nOptions:\nA.

The Arabs often cut off the inhabitants from their supply of drinking-water until the they buy them off with money and pieces of cloth. It is an exceedingly hot place. It is the port of the Indians, and to it come large vessels from Kinbayat [Cambay], Kawlam [Quilon], Calicut and many other Malabar ports [on the south-west coast of India]. There are Indian merchants living there, as well as Egyptian merchants. Its inhabitants are all either merchants, porters, or fishermen. Some of the merchants are immensely rich, so rich that sometimes a single merchant is sole owner of a large ship with all it contains, and this is a subject of ostentation and rivalry amongst them.

The same is true in all the other mines: the silver mines of Potosi [and others]\u2026.The owners and stewards of the mines, whether Spaniards, mestizos, or Indians, are such tyrants, with no fear of God or Justice, because they are not audited and are not inspected twice a year\u2026.\nAnd they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines. The Indians, under the pretext of mining chores, are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains, and the Indians die. These Indians are not paid for their labor, and their work is kept hidden.\nAnd [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubines\u2026.And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]\u2026at their own expense, and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays.

But we do not want to be beaten. No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her\u2013\u2013because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: \"You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia.\" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: \"You are abundant,\" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: \"You are poor and impotent,\" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters\u2013\u2013to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism. You are backward, you are weak\u2013\u2013therefore you are wrong; hence you can be beaten and enslaved. You are mighty\u2013\u2013therefore you are right; hence we must be wary of you.\nThat is why we must no longer lag behind.\"\nJoseph Stalin, speech delivered at the first All-Union Conference of Leading Personnel of Socialist Industry, February 4, 1931\nThe reference to the \"continual beatings\" most directly supports which of the following decisions in later Soviet foreign policy?\nOptions:\nA.

One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . . He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. . . . On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals. . . . The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value. Beyond this country lies another called Malal, the king of which was sincerely attached to Islam, while the common people of his kingdom remained polytheists. Since then their rulers have been given the title of al-musulmani .\n\u2014The Book of Routes and Realms , by Abu Ubaydallah al-Bakri, eleventh-century Muslim historian and geographer\nWhat is the most likely explanation for a Muslim being in charge of the Ghanian treasury?\nOptions:\nA.

On whom therefore is the labor of avenging these wrongs and of recovering this territory incumbent, if not upon you? You, upon whom above other nations God has conferred remarkable glory in arms, great courage, bodily activity, and strength to humble the hairy scalp of those who resist you.\nLet the deeds of your ancestors move you and incite your minds to manly achievements; the glory and greatness of king Charles the Great, and of his son Louis, and of your other kings, who have destroyed the kingdoms of the pagans, and extended in these lands the territory of the holy church. Let the holy sepulchre of the Lord our Savior, which is possessed by unclean nations, especially incite you, and the holy places which are now treated with ignominy and irreverently polluted with their filthiness. Oh, most valiant soldiers and descendants of invincible ancestors, be not degenerate, but recall the valor of your progenitors.\nJerusalem is the navel of the world; the land is fruitful above others, like another paradise of delights. This the Redeemer of the human race has made illustrious by His advent, has beautified by residence, has consecrated by suffering, has redeemed by death, has glorified by burial. This royal city, therefore, situated at the center of the world, is now held captive by His enemies, and is in subjection to those who do not know God, to the worship of the heathens. She seeks therefore and desires to be liberated and does not cease to implore you to come to her aid. From you especially she asks succor, because, as we have already said, God has conferred upon you above all nations great glory in arms.

Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized.

The soldiery divided themselves into two companies . . . with orders to attack places without defenses and to carry off the inhabitants as well as seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields. . . . Whilst waiting for the return of the companies despatched to hunt Negroes, we went every day to the slave market where we bought at the following prices:\nA Negro with beard\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u202610 or 15,000 cowries.\nThey are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.\nAn adult Negress\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..10 or 15,000 cowries for the same reasons\nAn adolescent Negro\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.30,000 cowries\nA young Negress \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u202650\u201360,000 cowries\nThe price varies according to whether she is more or less beautiful.\nA male Negro child\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..45,000 cowries\nA female Negro child \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.35\u201340,000 cowries\nFinally, our caravan which had set out from Algeria with sixty-four camels and only sixteen persons, was now augmented by four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women. . . . It was at this point that suddenly a confused noise of cries and sobs passed from one group of slaves to another and reached our own. . . . Some rolled on the ground, clung to bushes and absolutely refused to walk. . . . They could only be got up with mighty lashes of the whip and by rendering them completely bloody.\nHow was the Arab trade in Africans different from the Atlantic slave trade?\nOptions:\nA. Unlike Arab slave merchants, those involved in the Atlantic slave trade were motivated by religion.\nB.

Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potos\u00ed have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.\nAntonio Vasquez de Espinosa, report on mining in Huanacavelica and Potos\u00ed, 1620s\nThe third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute. Some have paid in sables, others in red foxes, still others in cash. At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands, from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River. Moreover, almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors.\nHeinrich von F\u00fcch, \"On the Treatment of Natives in Northeast Siberia,\" 1744\nWhich of the following factors, not mentioned in the second passage, would have been most likely to create added difficulties for native Siberians attempting to fulfill their tribute obligations?\nOptions:\nA.

Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potos\u00ed have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.\nAntonio Vasquez de Espinosa, report on mining in Huanacavelica and Potos\u00ed, 1620s\nThe third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute. Some have paid in sables, others in red foxes, still others in cash. At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands, from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River. Moreover, almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors.\nHeinrich von F\u00fcch, \"On the Treatment of Natives in Northeast Siberia,\" 1744\nThe system of labor described in the first passage came into being in which of the following ways?\nOptions:\nA.

The law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction. The result was an important new stage in international contact. From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries. Secure trade routes made for prosperous merchants and wealthy, cosmopolitan cities.

A zamindar who paid revenue to the Mogul was clearly in a position of dependence, and if he wished to establish a claim to sovereignty, the first step was to refuse, or omit to pay revenue. Such an omission might, however, arise from various other causes, and it is probable that in Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur there were numerous chiefs and tribes occupying what constitutional lawyers would regard as an anomalous position, sometimes paying the stipulated revenue, sometimes in open rebellion, and sometimes enjoying practical independence because the Mogul authorities found it inconvenient to undertake active measures of coercion.\"\nW.H.

He also stated that there are pagan nations in his kingdom from whom he does not collect the tribute (jizya) but whom he simply employs in extracting the gold from its deposits. The gold is extracted by digging pits about a man's height in depth and the gold is found embedded in the sides of the pits or sometimes collected at the bottom of them.\"\nFrom N. Levtzion & J.F.P.

To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil.

One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . . He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. . . . On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals. . . . The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value. Beyond this country lies another called Malal, the king of which was sincerely attached to Islam, while the common people of his kingdom remained polytheists. Since then their rulers have been given the title of al-musulmani .\n\u2014The Book of Routes and Realms , by Abu Ubaydallah al-Bakri, eleventh-century Muslim historian and geographer\nBased on the excerpt, which of the following statements correctly describes Islam's influence in Africa during this time period?\nOptions:\nA.

When they drew nigh to his person, they paid their respects by prostrating themselves on the floor. He immediately commanded them to rise, and to relate to him the circumstances of their travels, with all that had taken place in their negotiation with his holiness the pope. To their narrative, which they gave in the regular order of events, and delivered in perspicuous language, he listened with attentive silence. The letters and the presents from pope Gregory were then laid before him, and, upon hearing the former read, he bestowed much commendation on the fidelity, the zeal, and the diligence of his ambassadors; and receiving with due reverence the oil from the holy sepulchre, he gave directions that it should be preserved with religious care. Upon his observing Marco Polo, and inquiring who he was, Nicolo made answer, This is your servant, and my son; upon which the grand Khan replied, \"He is welcome, and it pleases me much,\" and he caused him to be enrolled amongst his attendants of honor. And on account of their return he made a great feast and rejoicing; and as long as the said brothers and Marco remained in the court of the grand Khan, they were honored even above his own courtiers. Marco was held in high estimation and respect by all belonging to the court. He learnt in a short time and adopted the manners of the Tartars, and acquired a proficiency in four different languages, which he became qualified to read and write.\"\nMarco Polo's Travels, ca. 1300 C.E.\nWhich of the following best characterizes one way in which the Mongol Empire was very different from the other major empires of the ancient and medieval worlds?\nOptions:\nA.

The Arabs often cut off the inhabitants from their supply of drinking-water until the they buy them off with money and pieces of cloth. It is an exceedingly hot place. It is the port of the Indians, and to it come large vessels from Kinbayat [Cambay], Kawlam [Quilon], Calicut and many other Malabar ports [on the south-west coast of India]. There are Indian merchants living there, as well as Egyptian merchants. Its inhabitants are all either merchants, porters, or fishermen. Some of the merchants are immensely rich, so rich that sometimes a single merchant is sole owner of a large ship with all it contains, and this is a subject of ostentation and rivalry amongst them.

The same is true in all the other mines: the silver mines of Potosi [and others]\u2026.The owners and stewards of the mines, whether Spaniards, mestizos, or Indians, are such tyrants, with no fear of God or Justice, because they are not audited and are not inspected twice a year\u2026.\nAnd they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines. The Indians, under the pretext of mining chores, are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains, and the Indians die. These Indians are not paid for their labor, and their work is kept hidden.\nAnd [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubines\u2026.And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]\u2026at their own expense, and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays. In this way, the Indians end up very poor and deep in debt, and they have no way to pay their tribute.\nThere is no remedy for all this, because any [colonial official] who enters comes to an agreement with the mine owners, and all the owners join forces in bribing him\u2026.Even the protector of the Indians is useless;\u2026he [does not] warn Your Majesty or your royal Audiencia [court] about the harms done to the poor Indians.\"\nExcerpt from The First New Chronicle and Good Government [abridged], by Felipe Guaman Poma de Alaya.

The soldiery divided themselves into two companies . . . with orders to attack places without defenses and to carry off the inhabitants as well as seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields. . . . Whilst waiting for the return of the companies despatched to hunt Negroes, we went every day to the slave market where we bought at the following prices:\nA Negro with beard\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u202610 or 15,000 cowries.\nThey are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.\nAn adult Negress\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..10 or 15,000 cowries for the same reasons\nAn adolescent Negro\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.30,000 cowries\nA young Negress \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u202650\u201360,000 cowries\nThe price varies according to whether she is more or less beautiful.\nA male Negro child\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..45,000 cowries\nA female Negro child \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.35\u201340,000 cowries\nFinally, our caravan which had set out from Algeria with sixty-four camels and only sixteen persons, was now augmented by four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women. . . . It was at this point that suddenly a confused noise of cries and sobs passed from one group of slaves to another and reached our own. . . . Some rolled on the ground, clung to bushes and absolutely refused to walk. . . . They could only be got up with mighty lashes of the whip and by rendering them completely bloody.\nWhich conclusion is supported by the passage?\nOptions:\nA.

It is to be set by the hands, with ligatures, and even cords applied, the one above and the other below the fracture. When the fracture takes place at one end, if at the head of the thigh, the middle part of a thong wrapped round with wool, so that it may not cut the parts there, is to be applied to the perineum, and the ends of it brought up to the head and given to an assistant to hold, and applying a ligature below the fracture, we give the ends of it to another assistant to make extension. If it is fractured near the knee, we apply the ligature immediately above the fracture, and give the ends to an assistant, with which to make extension upwards; and while we put a ligature round the knee to secure it, and while the patient lies thus, with his leg extended, we arrange the fracture.\"\nPaul of Aegina, Epitome: On the Fracture of the Thigh and Nose, late seventh century C.E.\nSource 2:\n\"Medicine considers the human body as to the means by which it is cured and by which it is driven away from health.

And because health and sickness and their causes are sometimes manifest, and sometimes hidden and not to be comprehended except by the study of symptoms, we must also study the symptoms of health and disease. Now it is established in the sciences that no knowledge is acquired save through the study of its causes and beginnings, if it has had causes and beginnings; nor completed except by knowledge of its accidents and accompanying essentials.\"\nIbn Sina (Avicenna), On Medicine, ca. 1020 C.E.\nThe two passages on medicine illustrate which of the following cultural exchanges that occurred in the period 600\u20131450 C.E.?\nOptions:\nA.

But we do not want to be beaten. No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her\u2013\u2013because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: \"You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia.\" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: \"You are abundant,\" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: \"You are poor and impotent,\" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters\u2013\u2013to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism. You are backward, you are weak\u2013\u2013therefore you are wrong; hence you can be beaten and enslaved. You are mighty\u2013\u2013therefore you are right; hence we must be wary of you.\nThat is why we must no longer lag behind.\"\nJoseph Stalin, speech delivered at the first All-Union Conference of Leading Personnel of Socialist Industry, February 4, 1931\nStalin's efforts to advance Russia as justified by his mention of the \"continual beatings\" were vindicated by which of the following historical events?\nOptions:\nA.

The Arabs often cut off the inhabitants from their supply of drinking-water until the they buy them off with money and pieces of cloth. It is an exceedingly hot place. It is the port of the Indians, and to it come large vessels from Kinbayat [Cambay], Kawlam [Quilon], Calicut and many other Malabar ports [on the south-west coast of India]. There are Indian merchants living there, as well as Egyptian merchants. Its inhabitants are all either merchants, porters, or fishermen. Some of the merchants are immensely rich, so rich that sometimes a single merchant is sole owner of a large ship with all it contains, and this is a subject of ostentation and rivalry amongst them.

Its administration favors the many instead of the few; this is why it is called a democracy. If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in their private differences; if no social standing, advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit; nor again does poverty bar the way, if a man is able to serve the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition. The freedom which we enjoy in our government extends also to our ordinary life. There, far from exercising a jealous surveillance over each other, we do not feel called upon to be angry with our neighbor for doing what he likes, or even to indulge in those injurious looks which cannot fail to be offensive, although they inflict no positive penalty. But all this ease in our private relations does not make us lawless as citizens. Against this fear is our chief safeguard, teaching us to obey the magistrates and the laws, particularly such as regard the protection of the injured, whether they are actually on the statute book, or belong to that code which, although unwritten, yet cannot be broken without acknowledged disgrace.\"\nThucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, ca. 415 B.C.E.\nWhich of the following correctly describes one of the primary reasons that Greek culture was disseminated widely around the Mediterranean region during the time period represented by the passage?\nOptions:\nA.

It may be answered that one should wish to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with. Because this is to be asserted in general of men, that they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as you succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood, property, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far distant; but when it approaches they turn against you. And that prince who, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other precautions, is ruined; because friendships that are obtained by payments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed be earned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied upon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails.\"\nNicolo Machiavelli, The Prince, ca. 1513 C.E.\nMachiavelli's treatise is best understood in the context of which of the following?\nOptions:\nA.

It may be answered that one should wish to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with. Because this is to be asserted in general of men, that they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as you succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood, property, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far distant; but when it approaches they turn against you. And that prince who, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other precautions, is ruined; because friendships that are obtained by payments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed be earned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied upon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails.\"\nNicolo Machiavelli, The Prince, ca. 1513 C.E.\nWhich of the following best characterizes the author's attitude in the passage?\nOptions:\nA.

To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.\nWilliam Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, \"On the Suppression of Sati,\" 1829\nI have made it my study to examine the nature and character of the Indians [who trade with us], and however repugnant it may be to our feelings, I am convinced they must be ruled with a rod of iron, to bring and keep them in a proper state of subordination, and the most certain way to effect this is by letting them feel their dependence on [the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them].\nGeorge Simpson, Head of Northern Department, Hudson's Bay Company, 1826\nThe passages above are best understood in the context of which of the following practices?\nOptions:\nA.

To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.\nWilliam Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, \"On the Suppression of Sati,\" 1829\nI have made it my study to examine the nature and character of the Indians [who trade with us], and however repugnant it may be to our feelings, I am convinced they must be ruled with a rod of iron, to bring and keep them in a proper state of subordination, and the most certain way to effect this is by letting them feel their dependence on [the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them].\nGeorge Simpson, Head of Northern Department, Hudson's Bay Company, 1826\nThe tone of the first passage best supports which of the following suppositions about British motivations for eradicating the sati ritual?\nOptions:\nA.

By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nWhat traditional view of world history does this passage seem to challenge?\nOptions:\nA.

One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . . He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. . . . On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals. . . . The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value. Beyond this country lies another called Malal, the king of which was sincerely attached to Islam, while the common people of his kingdom remained polytheists.
