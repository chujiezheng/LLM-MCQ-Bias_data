One example is serum methylmalonic acid as a biochemical functional index for vitamin B12 status. What is the primary aim of such biochemical functional index measurements?\nOptions:\nA. To achieve a better estimate of the dietary intake of the micronutrient.\nB. To overcome interference, eg by acute phase-linked effects.\nC.
